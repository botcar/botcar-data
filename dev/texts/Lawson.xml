                <p n="1"><hi rend="italics">'TIS a great Misfortune, that most of our Travellers, who go
                        to this vast Continent in</hi> America, <hi rend="italics">are Persons of
                        the meaner Sort, and generally of a very slender Education; who being hir’d
                        by the Merchants, to trade amongst the</hi> Indians, <hi rend="italics">in
                        which Voyages they often spend several Years, are yet, at their Return, <sic>uncapable</sic> of giving any reasonable Account of what they met withal in those
                        remote Parts; tho’ the Country abounds with Curiosities worthy a nice
                        Observation. In this Point, I think, the</hi> French <hi rend="italics">outstrip us.</hi></p>
                <p n="2">First, <hi rend="italics">By their Numerous Clergy, their Missionaries being
                        obedient to their Superiors in the highest Degree, and that Obedience being
                        one great Article of their Vow, and strictly observ’d amongst all their
                        Orders.</hi></p>
                <p n="3">Secondly, <hi rend="italics">They always send abroad some of their Gentlemen in
                        Company of the Missionaries, who, upon their Arrival, are order’d out into
                        the Wilderness, to make Discoveries, and to acquaint themselves with the
                        Savages of</hi> America; <hi rend="italics">and are oblig’d to keep a strict
                        Journal of all the Passages they meet withal, in order to present the same
                        not only to their Governors and Fathers, but likewise to their Friends and
                        Relations in</hi> France; <hi rend="italics">which is industriously spread
                        about that Kingdom, to their Advantage. For their Monarch being a very good
                        Judge of Mens Deserts, does not often let Money or Interest make Men of
                        Parts give Place to others of less Worth. This breeds an Honourable
                        Emulation amongst </hi>
                    <pb n="iv" xml:id="piv"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">them to outdo one another, even in Fatigues, and Dangers;
                        whereby they gain a good Correspondence with the</hi> Indians, <hi rend="italics">and acquaint themselves with their Speech and Customs; and so
                        make considerable Discoveries in a short time. Witness, their Journals
                        from</hi> Canada, <hi rend="italics">to the</hi>
                    <corr>Missisipi</corr>, <hi rend="italics">and its several Branches, where they
                        have effected great Matters, in a few Years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p n="4"><hi rend="italics">Having spent most of my Time, during my eight Years Abode
                        in</hi> Carolina, <hi rend="italics">in travelling; I not only survey’d the
                        Sea-Coast and those Parts which are already inhabited by the Christians, but
                        likewise view’d a spatious Tract of Land, lying betwixt the Inhabitants and
                        the Ledges of Mountains, from whence our noblest Rivers have their Rise,
                        running towards the Ocean, where they water as pleasant a Country as any in
                        Europe; the Discovery of which being never yet made <corr>publick</corr>, I
                        have, in the following Sheets, given you a faithful Account thereof, wherein
                        I have laid down every thing with Impartiality, and Truth, which is indeed,
                        the Duty of every</hi> Author, <hi rend="italics">and preferable to a smooth

                </p>
                <p n="2">IN the Year 1700, when People flock’d from all Parts of the Christian World, to
                    see the Solemnity of the Grand Jubilee at <hi rend="italics">Rome,</hi> my
                    Intention, at that Time, being to travel, I accidentally met with a Gentleman,
                    who had been Abroad, and was very well acquainted with the Ways of Living in
                    both <hi rend="italics">Indies;</hi> of <sic>whom,having</sic> made Enquiry concerning them, he assur’d me, that <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> was the best Country I could go to; and, that there then lay
                    a Ship in the <hi rend="italics">Thames,</hi> in which I might have my Passage.
                    I laid hold on this Opportunity, and was not long on Board, before we fell down
                    the River, and sail’d to <hi rend="italics">Cowes;</hi> where, having taken in
                    some Passengers, we proceeded on our Voyage, ’till we sprung a-leak, and were
                    forc’d into the Islands of <hi rend="italics">Seilly.</hi> Here we spent about
                    10 Days in refitting; in which Time we had a great deal of Diversion in Fishing
                    and Shooting on those rocky Islands. The Inhabitants were very courteous and
                    civil, especially the Governor, to whose good Company and Favour, we were very
                    much oblig’d. There is a Town on one of these Islands, where is good
                    Entertainment for those that happen to come in, though the Land is but mean, and
                    Flesh-meat not Plenty. They have good Store of Rabbits, Quails, and Fish and you
                    see at the poor Peoples Doors great Heaps of <sic>Perriwinkle-shells</sic>, those Fish being a great Part of their Food. On the 1st Day of <hi rend="italics">May,</hi> having a fair Wind at <hi rend="italics">East,</hi>
                    we put to Sea, and were on the Ocean (without speaking to any Vessel, except a
                    Ketch bound from <hi rend="italics">New England</hi> to <hi rend="italics">Barbadoes,</hi> laden with Horses, Fish, and Provisions) ’till the latter
                    End of <hi rend="italics">July,</hi> when the Winds hung so much <hi rend="italics">Southerly,</hi> that we could not get to our Port, but put
                    into <hi rend="italics">Sandybook-bay,</hi> and went up to <hi rend="italics">New York,</hi> after a pinching Voyage, caus’d by our long Passage. We
                    found at the Watering-Place, <pb n="2" xml:id="p2"/> a <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Man of War, who had on Board Men and Necessaries to make a
                    Colony, and was intended for the <sic><hi rend="italics">Messiasippi</hi></sic> River, there to settle. The Country of <hi rend="italics">New-York</hi> is very pleasant in Summer, but in the Winter very cold, as
                    all the <hi rend="italics">Northern</hi> Plantations are. Their chief
                    Commodities are Provisions, Bread, Beer, Lumber, and Fish in abundance; all
                    which are very good, and some Skins and Furrs are hence exported. The City is
                    govern’d by a Mayor, (as in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>) is seated on an
                    Island, and lies very convenient for Trade and Defence, having a regular Fort,
                    and well mounted with Guns. The Buildings are generally of a smaller Sort of <hi rend="italics">Flemish</hi> Brick, and of the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi>
                    Fashion, (excepting some few Houses:) They are all very firm and good Work, and
                    conveniently plac’d, as is likewise the Town, which gives a very pleasant
                    Prospect of the neighbouring Islands and Rivers. A good Part of the Inhabitants
                    are <hi rend="italics">Dutch,</hi> in whose Hands this Colony once was. After a
                    Fort-night’s Stay here, we put out from <hi rend="italics">Sandyhook,</hi> and
                    in 14 Days after, arriv’d at <hi rend="italics">Charles-Town,</hi> the
                    Metropolis of <hi rend="italics">South Carolina,</hi> which is <sic>scituate</sic> in 32, 45 <hi rend="italics">North</hi> Latitude, and admits of large
                    Ships to come over their Bar up to the Town, where is a very commodious Harbour,
                    about 5 Miles distant from the Inlet, and stands on a Point very convenient for
                    Trade, being seated between two pleasant and navigable Rivers. The Town has very
                    regular and fair Streets, in which are good Buildings of Brick and Wood, and
                    since my coming thence, has had great Additions of beautiful, large
                    Brick-buildings, besides a strong Fort, and regular Fortifications made to
                    defend the Town. The Inhabitants, by their wise Management and
                        <corr>Industry,have</corr> much improv’d the Country, which is in as
                    thriving Circumstances at this Time, as any Colony on the Continent of <hi rend="italics">English America,</hi><sic rend=" and is">andis</sic> of more
                    Advantage to the Crown of <hi rend="italics">Great Britain,</hi> than any of the
                    other more <hi rend="italics">Northerly</hi> Plantations, (<hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> excepted.) This Colony
                    was at first planted by a genteel Sort of People, that were well acquainted with
                    Trade, and had either Money or Parts, to make good Use of the Advantages that
                    offer’d, as most of them have done, by raising themselves to great Estates, and
                    considerable Places of Trust, and Posts of <pb n="3" xml:id="p3"/> Honour, in
                    this thriving Settlement. Since the first Planters, abundance of <hi rend="italics">French</hi> and others have gone over, and rais’d themselves
                    to considerable Fortunes. They are very neat and exact in Packing and Shipping
                    of their Commodities; which Method has got them so great a Character Abroad,
                    that they generally come to a good Market with their Commodities; when
                    oftentimes the Product of other Plantations, are forc’d to be fold at lower
                    Prizes. They have a considerable Trade both to <hi rend="italics">Europe,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italics">West Indies,</hi> whereby they become rich, and are
                    supply’d with all Things necessary for Trade, and genteel Living, which several
                    other Places fall short of. Their co-habiting in a Town, has drawn to them
                    ingenious. People of most Sciences, whereby they have Tutors amongst them that
                    educate their Youth a-la-mode.</p>
                <p n="3">Their Roads, with great Industry, are made very good and pleasant. Near the Town
                    is built a fair Parsonage-house, with necessary Offices, and the Minister has a
                    very considerable Allowance from his Parish. There is likewise a <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Church in Town, of the Reform’d Religion, and
                    several Meeting-houses for dissenting Congregations, who all enjoy at this Day
                    an entire Liberty of their Worship; the Constitution of this Government,
                    allowing all Parties of well-meaning Christians to enjoy a free Toleration, and
                    possess the same <sic>Priviledges</sic>, so long as they appear to behave themselves peaceably and well : It
                    being the Lords Proprietors Intent, that the Inhabitants of <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> should be as free from Oppression, as any in the Universe;
                    which doubtless they will, if their own Differences amongst themselves do not
                    occasion the contrary.</p>
                <p n="4">They have a well-disciplin’d <hi rend="italics">Militia;</hi> their Horse are
                    most Gentlemen, and well mounted, and the best in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> and may equalize any in other Parts: Their Officers, both
                    Infantry and Cavalry, generally appear in scarlet Mountings, and as rich as in
                    most Regiments belonging to the Crown, which shews the Richness and Grandeur of
                    this Colony. They are a <sic>Fronteer</sic>, and prove such troublesome Neighbours to the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards,</hi> that they have once laid their Town of St. <hi rend="italics">Augustine</hi> in Ashes, and drove away their Cattle; besides
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="p4"/> many Encounters and Engagements, in which they have
                    defeated them, too tedious to relate here. What the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> got by their Attempt against <hi rend="italics">South
                        Carolina,</hi> will hardly ever be rank’d amongst their Victories; their
                    Admiral <hi rend="italics">Monville</hi> being glad to leave the Enterprize, and
                    run away, after he had suffer’d all the Loss and Disgrace he was capable of
                    receiving. They are absolute Masters over the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi>
                    and carry so strict a Hand over such as are within the Circle of their Trade,
                    that none does the least Injury to any of the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi>
                    but he is presently sent for, and punish’d with Death, or otherwise, according
                    to the Nature of the Fault. They have an entire Friendship with the neighbouring
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of several Nations, which are a very warlike
                    People, ever faithful to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and have prov’d
                    themselves brave and true on all Occasions; and are a great Help and Strength to
                    this Colony. The Chief of the savage Nations have heretofore groan’d under the
                        <hi rend="italics">Spanish</hi> Yoke, and having experienc’d their Cruelty,
                    are become such mortal Enemies to that People, that they never give a <hi rend="italics">Spaniard</hi> Quarter; but generally, when they take any
                    Prisoners, (if the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> be not near to prevent it) <sic>sculp</sic> them, that is, to take their Hair and Skin of their Heads, which they
                    often flea away, whilst the Wretch is alive. Notwithstanding the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> have us’d all their Endeavours, yet they could
                    never bring them to leave this Barbarity to the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards;</hi> who, as they <sic>alledge</sic>, use to murder them and their Relations, and make Slaves of them to
                    build their Forts and Towns.</p>
                <p n="5">This Place is more plentiful in Money, than most, or indeed any of the
                    Plantations on the Continent; besides, they build a considerable Number of
                    Vessels of Cedar, and other Wood, with which they trade to <hi rend="italics">Cuirassau,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">West Indies;</hi> from one they
                    bring Money, and from the other the Produce of their Islands, which yields a
                    necessary Supply of both to the Colony. Their Stocks of Cattle are incredible,
                    being from one to two thousand Head in one Man’s Possession : These feed in the
                        <hi rend="italics">Savannas,</hi> and other Grounds, and need no Fodder in
                    the Winter. Their Mutton and Veal is good, and their Pork is not inferior to any
                    in <hi rend="italics">America.</hi> As for Pitch and Tar, none of the
                    Plantations are comparable for affording <pb n="5" xml:id="p5"/> the vast
                    Quantities of Naval Stores, as this Place does. There have been heretofore some
                    Discoveries of rich Mines in the <sic>mountanous</sic> Part of this Country; but being remote from the present Settlement,
                    and the Inhabitants not well vers’d in ordering Minerals, they have been laid
                    aside ’till a more fit Opportunity happens. There are several noble Rivers, and
                    spacious Tracts of rich Land in their Lordships Dominions, lying to the <hi rend="italics">Southward,</hi> which are yet uninhabited, besides <hi rend="italics">Port Royal,</hi> a rare Harbour and Inlet, having many
                    Inhabitants thereon, which their Lordships have now made a Port for Trade. This
                    will be a most advantageous Settlement, lying so commodiously for Ships coming
                    from the Gulph, and the Richness of the Land, which is reported to be there.
                    These more <hi rend="italics">Southerly</hi> Parts will afford Oranges, <sic>Limons</sic>, Limes, and many other Fruits, which the <hi rend="italics">Northerly</hi> Plantations yield not.</p>
                <p n="6">The Merchants of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> are fair, frank Traders. The
                    Gentlemen seated in the Country, are very courteous, live very nobly in their
                    Houses, and give very genteel Entertainment to all Strangers and others, that
                    come to visit them. And since the Produce of <hi rend="italics">South</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italics">North Carolina</hi> is the same, unless Silk, which this
                    Place produces great Quantities of, and very good, <hi rend="italics">North
                        Carolina</hi> having never made any Tryal thereof as yet, therefore I shall
                    refer the natural Produce of this Country, to that Part which treats of <hi rend="italics">North Carolina,</hi> whose Productions are much the same. The
                    Christian Inhabitants of both Colonies pretty equal, but the Slaves of <hi rend="italics">South Carolina</hi> are far more in Number than those in the
                        <hi rend="italics">North.</hi> I shall now proceed to relate my Journey
                    thro’ the Country, from this Settlement to the other, and then treat of the
                    natural History of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> with other remarkable
                    Circumstances which I have met with, during my eight Years Abode in that
                    Country.</p>

                <p n="2">ON <hi rend="italics">December</hi> the 28th, 1700, I began my Voyage (for <hi rend="italics">North Carolina</hi>) from <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi>-Town, being six <hi rend="italics">English</hi>-men in Company,
                    with three <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>-men, and one Woman, Wife to our <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>-Guide, having five Miles from the Town to the
                    Breach we went down in a large Canoe, that we had provided for our Voyage
                    thither, having the Tide of Ebb along with us; which was so far spent by that
                    Time we got down, that we had not Water enough for our Craft to go over,
                    although we drew but two Foot, or there-abouts. This Breach is a Passage through
                    a Marsh lying to the <hi rend="italics">Northward</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Sullivans</hi> Island, the Pilot’s having a Look out thereon, lying very
                    commodious for Mariners, (on that Coast) making a good Land-Mark in so level a
                    Country, this Bar being difficult to hit, where an Observation hath been wanting
                    for a Day or two; <hi rend="italics">North East</hi> Winds bringing great Fogs,
                    Mists, and Rains; which, towards the cool Months of <hi rend="italics">October,

                    often appear in these Parts. There are three Pilots to attend, and conduct Ships
                    over the Bar. The Harbour where the Vessels generally ride, is against the Town
                    on <hi rend="italics">Cooper’s</hi> River, lying within a Point which parts that
                    and <hi rend="italics">Ashley</hi>-River, they being Land-lock’d almost on all

                <p n="3">At 4 in the Afternoon, (at half Flood) we pass’d with our Canoe over the Breach,
                    leaving <hi rend="italics">Sullivans</hi> Island on our Star board. The first
                    Place we design’d for, was <hi rend="italics">Santee</hi> River, on which there
                    is a Colony of <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Protestants, allow’d and
                    encourag’d by the Lords Proprietors. At Night we got to <hi rend="italics">Bell’s</hi>-Island, a poor Spot of Land, being about ten Miles round, where

                    suitable in Neatness and Contrivance. They are all of the same Opinion with the

                    concerning the <hi rend="italics">Punctilio’s</hi> of their Christian Faith;
                    which Union hath propagated a happy and delightful Concord in all other Matters
                    throughout the whole Neighbourhood; living amongst themselves as one Trible, or
                    Kindred, every one making it his Business to be assistant to the Wants of his
                    Country-man, preserving his Estate and Reputation with the same Exactness and
                    Concern as he does his own; all seeming to share in the Misfortunes, and <sic>rejoyce</sic> at the Advance, and Rise, of their Brethren.</p>

                    stay’d for the <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> who was our Guide, and was gone
                    round by Water in a small Canoe, to meet us at that Place <sic>werestedat</sic>. He came after a small Time, and ferry’d us in that little Vessel over
                        <hi rend="italics">Santee</hi> River 4 Miles, and 84 Miles in the Woods,
                    which the over-flowing of the Freshes, which then came down, had made a perfect
                    Sea of, there running an incredible Current in the River, which had cast our
                    small Craft, and us, away, had we not had this <hi rend="italics">Sewee
                        Indian</hi> with us; who are excellent Artists in managing these small

                <p n="23"><hi rend="italics">Santee</hi> River, at this Time, (from the usual Depth of
                    Water) was risen perpendicular 36 Foot, always making a Breach from her Banks,
                    about this Season of the Year: The general Opinion of the Cause thereof, is
                    suppos’d to proceed from the overflowing of fresh Water-Lakes that lie near the
                    Head of this River, and others, upon the same Continent: But my Opinion is, that
                    these vast Inundations proceed from the great and repeated Quantities of Snow
                    that falls upon the Mountains, which lie at so great a Distance from the Sea,
                    therefore they have no Help of being dissolv’d by those saline, piercing
                    Particles, as other adjacent Parts near the Ocean receive; and therefore lies
                    and increases to a vast Bulk, until some mild <hi rend="italics">Southerly</hi>
                    Breezes coming on a sudden, continue to unlock these frozen Bodies, congeal’d by
                    the <hi rend="italics">North-West</hi> Wind, dissipating <pb n="15" xml:id="p15"/> them in Liquids; and coming down with Impetuosity, fills those Branches that
                    feed these Rivers, and causes this strange Deluge, which oft-times lays under
                    Water the adjacent Parts on both Sides this Current, for several Miles distant
                    from her Banks; tho’ the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> affir’m'd to me, they never knew such an extraordinary Flood
                    there before.</p>
                <p n="24">We all, by God’s Blessing, and the Endeavours of our <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>-Pilot, pass’d safe over the River, but was lost in the Woods,
                    which seem’d like some great Lake, except here and there a <sic>Knowl</sic> of high Land, which appear’d above Water.</p>
                <p n="25">We intended for Mons. <hi rend="italics">Galliar'</hi>s, <hi rend="italics">jun',</hi> but was lost, none of us knowing the Way at that Time, altho'

                    differing, it was agreed on amongst us, that one half should go with the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> to find the House, and the other part to stay
                    upon one of these dry Spots, until some of them return’d to us, and inform’d us
                    where it lay.</p>
                <p n="26">My self and two more were left behind, by Reason the Canoe would not carry us
                    all; we had but one Gun amongst us, one Load of Ammunition, and no Provision.
                    Had our Men in the Canoe miscarry’d, we must (in all Probability) there have
                    perish’d.</p>
                <p n="27">In about six Hours Time, from our Mens Departure, the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> came back to us in the same Canoe he went in, being half drunk,
                    which assur’d us they had found some Place of Refreshment. He took us three into
                    the Canoe, telling us all was well: <sic>Padling</sic> our Vessel several Miles thro’ the Woods, being often half full of
                    Water; but at length we got safe to the Place we sought for, which prov’d to lie
                    the same Way the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> and I guess’d it did.</p>
                <p n="28">When we got to the House, we found our Comrades in the same Trim the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> was in, and several of the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Inhabitants with them, <sic>whotreated</sic> us very courteously, wondering at our undertaking such a Voyage, thro’
                    a Country inhabited by none but Savages, and them of so different Nations and
                    Tongues.</p>
                <p n="29">After we had refresh’d our selves, we parted from a very <pb n="16" xml:id="p16"/> kind, loving, and affable People, who wish’d us a safe and prosperous

                    nothing but a small Pole for a Bridge, over a Creek, fell into the Water up to
                    the Chin; my self laughing at the Accident, and not taking good Heed to my
                    Steps, came to the same Misfortune: All our Bedding was wet. The Wind being at

                    we awak’d, we were nigh frozen to Death, until we had recruited our selves

                <p n="36">The next Day we travell’d on our Way, and about Noon came up with a Settlement of
                        <hi rend="italics">Santee Indians,</hi> there being Plantations lying
                    scattering here and there, for a great many Miles. They came out to meet us,
                    being acquainted with one of our Company, and made us very welcome with fat
                    barbacu’d Venison, which the Woman of the Cabin took and tore in Pieces with her
                    Teeth, so put it into a Mortar, beating it to Rags, afterwards stews it with
                    Water, and other Ingredients, which makes a very favoury Dish.</p>
                <p n="37">At these Cabins came to visit us the King of the <hi rend="italics">Santee</hi>
                    Nation. He brought with him their chief Doctor or Physician, who was warmly and
                    neatly clad with a Match-Coat, made of Turkies Feathers, which makes a pretty <sic>Shew</sic>, seeming as if it was a Garment of the deepest silk Shag. This Doctor
                    had the Misfortune to lose his Nose by the Pox, which Disease the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> often get by the <hi rend="italics">English</hi>
                    Traders that use amongst them; not but the Natives of <hi rend="italics">America</hi> have for many Ages (by their own Confession) been afflicted
                    with a Distemper much like the <hi rend="italics">Lues Venerea,</hi> which hath
                    all the Symptoms of the Pox, being different in this only; for I never could
                    learn, that this Country-Distemper, or Yawes, is begun or continu’d with a
                    Gonorrhœa; yet is attended with nocturnal Pains in the Limbs, and commonly makes
                    such a Progress, as to vent Part of the Matter by Botches, and several Ulcers in
                    the Body, and other Parts; oftentimes Death ensuing. I have known mercurial
                    Unguents and Remedies work a Cure, following the same Methods as in the Pox;
                    several white People, but chiefly the <hi rend="italics">Criolo’s,</hi> losing
                    their Palates and Noses by this devouring Vulture.</p>
                <p n="38">It is epidemical, visiting these Parts of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> which
                    is often occasion’d thro’ the immoderate drinking of Rum, by those that commonly
                    drink Water at other Times, cold Nights Lodging, and bad open Houses, and more
                    chiefly by often wetting the Feet, and eating such Quantities of Pork as they
                    do, which is a gross Food, and a great Propagator of such <pb n="19" xml:id="p19"/> Juices as it often meets withal in human Bodies, once tainted
                    with this Malady; which may differently (in some Respects) act its Tragedy; the
                    Change being occasion’d by the Difference of Climates and Bodies, as in <hi rend="italics">Europe.</hi> We being well enough assur’d that the Pox had
                    its first Rise (known to us) in this new World, it being caught of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Women, by the <hi rend="italics">Spanish</hi>
                    Soldiers that follow’d <hi rend="italics">Columbus</hi> in one of his
                    Expeditions to <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> who after their Arrival in <hi rend="italics">Old Spain,</hi> were hasten’d to the Relief of <hi rend="italics">Naples,</hi> at that Time besieg’d by the <hi rend="italics">French.</hi> Provisions growing scarce, the useless People were turn’d out
                    of the City, to lessen the Mouths; amongst these, the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Curtesans</sic></hi> were one Part, who had frequently embrac’d the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards,</hi> being well fraught with Riches by their new
                    Discovery. The Leager Ladies had no sooner lost their <hi rend="italics">Spanish</hi> Dons, but found themselves as well entertain’d by the <hi rend="italics">French,</hi> whose Camp they traded in, giving the Monsieurs
                    as large a Share of the pocky Spoils within their own Lines, as the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> had, who took the Pains to bring it in their
                    Breeches as far as from <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> the large Supplies of <sic>Swines</sic> Flesh, which that Army was chiefly victuall’d withal, made it rage.
                    The Siege was rais’d; the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> retreating to <hi rend="italics">Flanders,</hi> which was <sic>s</sic>
                    <sic>Parrade</sic> of all Nations; by which Means, this filthy Distemper crowded it self
                    into most Nations of the known World.</p>
                <p n="39">Now to return to our Doctor, who in the Time of his Affliction withdrew himself
                    (with one that labour’d under the same Distemper) into the Woods. These two
                    perfected their Cures by proper Vegitables, &amp; <hi rend="italics">c.</hi> of
                    which they have Plenty, and are well acquainted with their specifick Virtue.</p>
                <p n="40">I have seen such admirable Cures perform’d by these Savages, which would puzzle a
                    great many graduate Practitioners to trace their Steps in Healing, with the same
                    Expedition, Ease, and Success; using no racking Instruments in their Chirurgery,
                    nor nice Rules of Diet and <sic>Physick</sic>, to verify the Saying, <foreign xml:lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">qui
                            Medice vivit, misere vivit.</hi></foreign> In Wounds which penetrate
                    deep, and seem mortal, they order a spare Diet, with drinking Fountain-water; if
                    they perceive a white Matter, or Pus to arise, they let the Patient more at
                    large, and presently cure him.</p>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="p20"/>
                <p n="41">After these two had perform’d their Cures at no easier Rate than the <sic>Expence</sic> of both their Noses, coming again amongst their old Acquaintance so
                    disfigur’d, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> admir’d to see them
                    metamorphos’d after that manner; enquir’d of them where they had been all that
                    Time, and what were become of their Noses? They made Answer, That they had been
                    conversing with the white Man above, (meaning God Almighty) how they were very
                    kindly entertain’d by that Great Being; he being much pleas’d with their Ways,
                    and had promis’d to make their Capacities equal with the white People in making
                    Guns, Ammunition, &amp; <hi rend="italics">c.</hi> in <sic>Retalliation</sic> of which, they had given him their Noses. The Verity of which, they
                    yet hold, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> being an easy, credulous People,
                    and most notoriously cheated by their Priests and Conjurers, both Trades meeting
                    ever in one Person, and most commonly a Spice of Quackship added to the other
                    two Ingredients, which renders that cunning Knave the Impostor to be more rely’d
                    upon; thence a fitter Instrument to cheat these ignorant People; the Priest and
                    Conjurers being never admitted to their Practice, ’till Years and the Experience
                    of repeated Services hath wrought their Esteem amongst the Nations they belong
                    to.</p>
                <p n="42">The <hi rend="italics">Santee</hi> King, who was in Company with this No-nos’d
                    Doctor, is the most absolute <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Ruler in these
                    Parts, although he is Head but of a small People, in Respect to some other
                    Nations of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that I have seen: He can put any of
                    his People to Death that hath committed any Fault which he judges worthy of so
                    great a Punishment. This Authority is rarely found amongst these Savages, for
                    they act not (commonly) by a determinative Voice in their Laws, towards any one
                    that hath committed Murder, or such other great Crime, but take this Method; him
                    to whom the Injury was done, or if dead, the nearest of his Kindred Prosecutes
                    by Way of an actual Revenge, being himself, if Opportunity serves his Intent,
                    both Judge and Executioner, performing so much Mischief on the Offender, or his
                    nearest Relation, until such Time that he is fully satisfy’d: Yet this Revenge
                    is not so infallible, but it may be bought `off with Beads, Tobacco, and such
                    like Commodities that are <pb n="21" xml:id="p21"/> useful amongst them, though
                    it were the most sable <sic>Villany</sic> that could be acted by Mankind.</p>
                <p n="43">Some that attended the King, presented me with an odoriferous,
                    Root, of a fragrant Smell and Taste, the Name I know not; they chew it in the
                    Mouth, and by that simple Application, heal desperate Wounds both green and old;
                    that small Quantity I had, was given inwardly to those troubled with the <sic>Belly-ach</sic>, which Remedy fail’d not to give present Help, the Pain leaving the
                    Patient soon after they had taken the Root.</p>
                <p n="44">Near to these Cabins are several Tombs made after the manner of these <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> the largest and the chiefest of them was the
                    Sepulchre of the late <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> King of the <hi rend="italics">Santees,</hi> a Man of great Power, not only amongst his own
                    Subjects, but dreaded by the neighbouring Nations for his great Valour and
                    Conduct, having as large a Prerogative in his Way of Ruling, as the present King
                    I now spoke of.</p>
                <p n="45">The manner of their Interment, is thus: A Mole or Pyramid of Earth is rais’d, the
                    Mould thereof being work’d very smooth and even, sometimes higher or lower,
                    according to the Dignity of the Person whose Monument it is. On the Top thereof
                    is an Umbrella, made Ridge-ways, like the Roof of an House; this is supported by
                    nine Stakes, or small Posts, the Grave being about six or eight Foot in Length,
                    and four Foot in Breadth; about it is hung Gourds Feathers, and other such like
                    Trophies, plac’d there by the dead Man’s Relations, in Respect to him in the
                    Grave. The other Part of the Funeral-Rites are thus, As soon as the Party is
                    dead, they lay the Corps upon a Piece of Bark in the Sun, seasoning or embalming
                    it with a small Root beaten to Powder, which looks as red as Vermilion; the same
                    is mix’d with Bear’s Oil, to beautify the Hair, and preserve their Heads from
                    being lousy, it growing plentifully in these Parts of <hi rend="italics">America.</hi> After the Carcass has laid a Day or two in the Sun, they
                    remove and lay it upon Crotches cut on purpose for the Support thereof from the
                    Earth; then they anoint it all over with the fore-mention’d Ingredients of the
                    Powder of this Root, and Bear’s Oil. When it is so done, they cover it very
                    exactly over with Bark of the Pine or Cyprus Tree, to prevent any Rain to fall
                    upon it, <pb n="22" xml:id="p22"/> sweeping the Ground very clean all about it.
                    Some of his nearest of Kin brings all the temporal Estate he was possess’d of at
                    his Death, as Guns, Bows, and Arrows, Beads, Feathers, Match-coat, &amp; <hi rend="italics">c.</hi> This Relation is the chief Mourner, being clad in
                    Moss, and a Stick in his Hand, keeping a mournful Ditty for three or four Days,
                    his Face being black with the smoak of Pitch, Pine, mingl’d with Bear’s Oil. All
                    the while he tells the dead Man’s Relations, and the rest of the Spectators, who
                    that dead Person was, and of the great Feats perform’d in his Life-time; all
                    what he speaks, tending to the Praise of the Defunct. As soon as the Flesh grows
                    mellow, and will cleave from the Bone, they get it off, and burn it, making all
                    the Bones very clean, then anoint them with the Ingredients aforesaid, wrapping
                    up the Skull (very carefully) in a Cloath <sic>artifically</sic> woven of Possums Hair. (These <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> make
                    Girdles, Sashes, Garters, &amp;'<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> after the same
                    Manner.) The Bones they carefully preserve in a wooden Box, every Year oiling
                    and cleansing them: By these Means preserve them for many Ages, that you may see
                    an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> in Possession of the Bones of his
                    Grand-father, or some of his Relations of a larger Antiquity. They have other
                    Sorts of Tombs; as where an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> is slain, in that
                    very Place they make a Heap of Stones, (or Sticks, where Stones are not to be
                    found;) to this Memorial, every <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> that passes by,
                    adds a Stone, to augment the Heap, in Respect to the deceas’d Hero.</p>
                <p n="46">We had a very large Swamp to pass over near the House, and would have hir’d our
                    Landlord to have been our Guide, but he seem’d unwilling; so we press’d him no
                    farther about it. He was the tallest <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> I ever saw,
                    being seven Foot high, and a very strait <sic>compleat</sic> Person, esteem’d on by the King for his great Art in Hunting, always
                    carrying with him an artificial Head to hunt withal: They are made of the Head
                    of a Buck, the back Part of the Horns being <sic>scrapt</sic> and hollow, for Lightness of Carriage. The Skin is left to the setting
                    on of the Shoulders, which is lin’d all round with small Hoops, and flat Sort of
                    Laths, to hold it open for the Arm to go in. They have a Way to preserve the
                    Eyes, as if living. The Hunter puts on a Match-coat made of Deer’s Skin, with
                    the Hair on, and a Piece of the white Part of a Deer’s Skin, <pb n="23" xml:id="p23"/> that grows on the Breast, which is fasten’d to the Neck-End
                    of this stalking Head, so hangs down. In these Habiliments an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> will go as near a Deer as he pleases, the exact Motions and
                    Behaviour of a Deer being so well counterfeited by ’em, that several Times it
                    hath been known for two Hunters to come up with a stalking Head together, and
                    unknown to each other, so that they have kill’d an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> instead of a Deer, which hath happen’d sometimes to be a
                    Brother, or some dear Friend; for which Reason they allow not of that Sort of
                    Practice, where the Nation is populous.</p>
                <p n="47">Within half a Mile of the House, we pass’d over a prodigious wide and deep Swamp,
                    being forc’d to strip stark-naked, and much a-do to save our selves from
                    drowning in this <sic>Fatiegue</sic>. We, with much a-do, got thro', going that Day about five Miles
                    farther, and came to three more <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Cabins, call’d in
                    the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Tongue, <hi rend="italics">Hickerau,</hi> by
                    the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Traders, the <hi rend="italics">black
                        House,</hi> being pleasantly seated on a high Bank, by a Branch of <hi rend="italics">Santee</hi>-River. One of our Company, that had traded
                    amongst these <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> told us, That one of the Cabins
                    was his Father’s-in-Law; he call’d him so, by Reason the old Man had given him a
                    young <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Girl, that was his Daughter, to lie with
                    him, make Bread, and to be necessary in what she was capable to assist him in,
                    during his Abode amongst them.</p>
                <p n="48">When we came thither first, there was no Body at Home, so the Son made bold to
                    search his Father’s Granary for Corn, and other Provisions He brought us some
                        <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi><sic> Maiz</sic> and Peas, which are of a reddish Colour, and eat well, yet colour the
                    Liquor they are boil’d in, as if it were a <hi rend="italics">Lixivium</hi> of
                    red Tartar. After we had been about an Hour in the House, where was Millions of
                    Fleas, the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Cabins being often fuller of such
                    Vermin, than any Dog-Kennel, the old Man came in to us, and seem’d very glad to
                    see his Son-in-Law.</p>
                <p n="49">This <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> is a great Conjurer, as appears by the
                    Sequel. The <hi rend="italics">Seretee</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Santee
                        Indians</hi> were gone to War against the <hi rend="italics">Hooks</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italics">Backbooks</hi> Nations, living near the Mouth of <hi rend="italics">Winyan</hi>-River. Those that were left at Home, (which are
                    commonly old People and Children) had heard no News a long Time of their Men at
                    Arms. This Man, at the Entreaty of <pb n="24" xml:id="p24"/> these People,
                    (being held to be a great Sorcerer amongst ’em) went to know what Posture their
                    fighting Men were in. His Exorcism was carry’d on thus: He dress’d himself in a
                    clean white dress’d Deer Skin; a great Fire being made in the Middle of the
                    Plantation, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> sitting all round it, the
                    Conjurer was blind-folded, then he surrounded the Fire several Times, I think
                    thrice; leaving the Company, he went into the Woods, where he stay’d about half
                    an Hour, returning to them, surrounded the Fire as before; leaving them, went
                    the second Time into the Woods; at which Time there came a huge Swarm of Flies,
                    very large, they flying about the Fire several Times, at last fell all into it,
                    and were visibly consum’d. Immediately after the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>-Conjurer made a huge Lilleloo, and howling very frightfully,
                    presently an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> went and caught hold of him, leading
                    him to the Fire. The old Wizard was so feeble and weak, being not able to stand
                    alone, and all over in a Sweat, and as wet as if he had fallen into the River.
                    After some Time he recover’d his Strength, assuring them, that their Men were
                    near a River, and could not pass over it ’till so many Days, but would, in such
                    a Time, return all in Safety, to their Nation. All which prov’d true at the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> Return, which was not long after. This Story the
                        <hi rend="italics">English</hi>-man, his Son-in-Law, affirm’d to me.</p>
                <p n="50">The old Man stay’d with us about two Hours, and told us we were welcome to stay
                    there all Night, and take what his Cabin afforded; then leaving us, went into
                    the Woods, to some Hunting-Quarter not far off.</p>
                <p n="51">The next Morning early we pursu’d our Voyage, finding the Land to improve it self
                    in Pleasantness and Richness of Soil. When we had gone about ten Miles, one of
                    our Company tir’d, being not able to travel any farther; so we went forward,
                    leaving the poor dejected Traveller with Tears in his Eyes, to return to <hi rend="italics">Charles</hi>-Town, and travel back again over so much bad
                    Way, we having pass’d thro’ the worst of our Journey, the Land here being high
                    and dry, very few Swamps, and those dry, and a little Way through. We travell’d
                    about twenty Miles, lying near a Savanna that was over-flown with Water; where
                    we were very short of Victuals, but finding the Woods newly burnt, and on fire
                    in many Places, which gave us great Hopes that <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    were not far of.</p>

                    about ten a Clock came to a hunting Quarter, of a great many <hi rend="italics">Santees;</hi> they made us all welcome; shewing a great deal of Joy at our

                    Hours Refreshment, we went on, and got that Day about twenty Miles; we lay by a
                    small swift Run of Water, which was pav’d at the Bottom with a Sort of Stone
                    much like to Tripoli, and so light, that I fancy’d it would precipitate in no
                    Stream, but where it naturally grew. The Weather was very cold, the Winds
                    holding <hi rend="italics">Northerly.</hi> We made our selves as merry as we

                <p n="54">This Day all of us had a Mind to have rested, but the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> was much against it, <sic>alledging</sic>, That the Place we lay at, was not good to hunt in; telling us, if we
                    would go on, by Noon, he would bring us to a more convenient Place; so we mov’d
                    forwards, and about twelve a Clock came to the most amazing Prospect I had seen
                    since I had been in <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> we travell’d by a
                    Swamp-Side, which Swamp I believe to be no less than twenty Miles over, the
                    other Side being as far as I could well discern, there appearing great Ridges of
                    Mountains, bearing from us <hi rend="italics">W. N. W.</hi> One Alp with a Top
                    like a Sugar-loaf, advanc’d its Head above all the rest very considerably; the
                    Day was very serene, which gave us the Advantage of seeing a long Way; these
                    Mountains were cloth’d all over with Trees, which seem’d to us to be very large
                    Timbers.</p>
                <p n="55">At the Sight of this fair Prospect, we stay’d all Night; our <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> going about half an Hour before us, had provided three fat
                    Turkeys e’er we got up to him.</p>
                <p n="56">The Swamp I now spoke of, is not a miry Bog, as others generally are, but you go
                    down to it thro’ a steep Bank, at the Foot of which, begins this Valley, where
                    you may go dry for perhaps 200 Yards, then you meet with a Small Brook, <pb n="26" xml:id="p26"/> or Run of Water, about 2 or 3 Foot deep, then dry Land
                    for such another Space, so another Brook, thus continuing. The Land in this
                    Percoarson, or Valley, being extraordinary rich, and the Runs of Water well
                    stor’d with Fowl. It is the Head of one of the Branches of <hi rend="italics">Santee</hi>-River; but a farther Discovery Time would not permit; only one
                    Thing is very remarkable, there growing all over this Swamp, a tall, lofty
                    Bay-tree, but is not the same as in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> these being
                    in their Verdure all the Winter long; which appears here, when you stand on the
                    Ridge, (where our Path lay) as if it were one pleasant, green Field, and as even
                    as a Bowling-green to the Eye of the Beholder; being hemm’d in on one Side with
                    these Ledges of vast high Mountains.</p>
                <p n="57">Viewing the Land here, we found an extraordinary rich, black Mould, and some of a
                    Copper-colour, both Sorts very good; the Land in some Places is much burthen’d
                    with Iron, Stone, here being great Store of it, seemingly very good: The eviling
                    Springs, which are many in these Parts, issuing out of the Rocks, which Water we
                    drank of, it colouring the Excrements of Travellers (by its chalybid Quality) as
                    black as a Coal. When we were all asleep, in the Beginning of the Night, we were
                    awaken’d with the dismall’st and most hideous Noise that ever pierc’d my Ears:
                    This sudden Surprizal incapacitated us of guessing what this <sic>threatning</sic> Noise might proceed from; but our <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Pilot
                    (who knew these Parts very well) acquainted us, that it was customary to hear
                    such <corr>Musick</corr> along that Swamp-side, there being endless Numbers of
                    Panthers, Tygers, Wolves, and other Beasts of Prey, which take this Swamp for
                    their Abode in the Day, coming in whole Droves to hunt the Deer in the Night,
                    making this frightful Ditty ’till Day appears, then all is still as in other
                    Places.</p>

                    the tenth Part of Foggy-falling Weather towards these Mountains, as visits those
                    Parts. Near the Sea-board, the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> kill’d 15 Turkeys
                    this Day; there coming out of the Swamp, (about Sun-rising) Flocks of these

                    our Guide kill’d more Turkeys, and two <sic>Polcats</sic>, which he eat, esteeming them before fat Turkeys. Some of the Turkeys
                    which we eat, whilst we stay’d there, I believe, weigh’d no less than 40
                    Pounds.</p>
                <p n="60">The Land we pass’d over this Day, was most of it good, and the worst passable. At
                    Night we kill’d a Possum, being cloy’d with <sic>Turkeys,made</sic> a Dish of that, which tasted much between young Pork and Veal; their

                    with his Gun, he always shot with a single Ball, missing but two Shoots in above
                    forty; they being curious <sic>Artifts</sic> in managing a Gun, to make it carry either Ball, or Shot, true. When
                    they have bought a <sic>Piece,and</sic> find it to shoot any Ways <sic>crooked,they</sic> take the Barrel out of the Stock, cutting a Notch in a Tree, wherein
                    they set it streight, sometimes shooting away above 100 Loads of Ammunition,
                    before they bring the Gun to shoot according to their Mind. We took up our
                    Quarters by a Fish-pond-side; the Pits in the Woods that stand full of Water,
                    naturally breed Fish in them, in great Quantities. We cook’d our <sic>Supper,but</sic> having neither <sic>Bread,or</sic>

                    pass’d by several fair Savanna’s, very rich and dry; seeing great Copses of many
                    Acres that bore nothing but Bushes, about the Bigness of Box-trees; which (in
                    the Season) afford great Quantities of small Black-berries, very pleasant Fruit,
                    and much like to our Blues, or Huckle-berries, that grow on Heaths in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> Hard by the Savanna’s we found the Town, where
                    we halted; there was not above one Man left with the Women, the rest being gone
                    a Hunting for a Feast. The Women were very busily engag’d in Gaming: The Name or
                    Grounds of it, I could not learn, tho’ I look’d on above two Hours. Their
                    Arithmetick was kept with a Heap of <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="p28"/> Grain. When their Play was ended, the King, or <hi rend="italics">Cassetta</hi>'s Wife, invited us into her Cabin. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Kings always entertaining Travellers, either <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Indian;</hi> taking it as
                    a great Affront, if they pass by their Cabins, and take up their Quarters at any
                    other <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>'s House. The Queen set Victuals before us,
                    which good Compliment they use generally as soon as you come under their
                    Roof.</p>
                <p n="63">The Town consists not of above a dozen Houses, they having other <sic>stragling</sic> Plantations up and down the Country, and are feated upon a small
                    Branch of <hi rend="italics">Santee</hi>-River. Their Place hath curious dry
                    Marshes, and Savanna’s adjoining to it, and would prove an exceeding thriving
                    Range for Cattle, and Hogs, provided the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> were
                    feated thereon. Besides, the Land is good for Plantations.</p>
                <p n="64">These <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are a small People, having lost much of
                    their former Numbers, by intestine Broils; but most by the Small-pox, which hath
                    often visited them, sweeping away whole Towns; occasion’d by the immoderate
                    Government of themselves in their Sickness; as I have mention’d before, treating
                    of the <hi rend="italics">Sewees.</hi> Neither do I know any Savages that have
                    traded with the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> but what have been great Losers
                    by this Distemper.</p>
                <p n="65">We found here good Store of Chinkapin-Nuts, which they gather in Winter great
                    Quantities of, drying them; so keep these Nuts in great Baskets for their Use;
                    likewife <sic>Hickerie-Nuts</sic>, which they beat betwixt two great Stones, then sift them, so thicken
                    their <sic>Venison-Broath</sic> therewith; the small Shells precipitating to the Bottom of the Pot,
                    whilst the Kernel in Form of Flower, mixes it with the Liquor. Both these Nuts
                    made into Meal, makes a curious Soop, either with clear Water, or in any

                    being dry and healthful; for tho’ this most bears a Seed in a Sort of a small

                <p n="67">The <hi rend="italics">Congerees</hi> are kind and affable to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> the Queen being very kind, giving us what
                    Rarities her Cabin afforded, as Loblolly made with <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn, and dry’d Peaches. These <hi rend="italics">Congerees</hi> have abundance of Storks and Cranes in their Savannas. They
                    take them before they can fly, and breed ’em as tame and familiar as a Dung-hill
                    Fowl. They had a tame Crane at one of these Cabins, that was scarce less than
                    six Foot in Height, his Head being round, with a shining natural Crimson Hue,
                    which they all have. These are a very comely Sort of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> there being a strange Difference in the Proportion and Beauty
                    of these Heathens. Altho’ their Tribes or Nations border one upon another, yet
                    you may discern as great an Alteration in their Features and Dispositions, as
                    you can in their Speech, which generally proves quite different from each other,
                    though their Nations be not above 10 or 20 Miles in Distance. The Women here
                    being as handsome as most I have met withal, being several fine-finger’d
                    Brounetto’s amongst them. These Lasses stick not upon Hand long, for they marry
                    when very young, as at 12 or 14 Years of Age. The <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Traders are seldom without an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    Female for his Bed-fellow, <sic>alledging</sic> these Reasons as sufficient to allow of such a Familiarity. First,
                    They being remote from any white People, that it preserves their Friendship with
                    the Heathens, they esteeming a white Man’s Child much above one of their
                    getting, the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Mistress ever securing her white
                    Friend Provisions whilst he stays amongst them. And lastly, This Correspondence
                    makes them learn the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Tongue much the sooner, they
                    being of the <hi rend="italics">French</hi>-man’s Opinion, how that an <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Wife teaches her Husband more <hi rend="italics">English</hi> in one Night, than a School-master can in a Week.</p>
                <p n="68">We saw at the <hi rend="italics">Cassetta</hi>'s Cabin the strangest Spectacle of
                    Antiquity I ever knew, it being an old <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    <sic>Squah</sic>, that, had I been to have guess’d at her Age by her Aspect, old <hi rend="italics">Parr</hi>'s Head (the <hi rend="italics">Welch
                        Methusalem</hi>) was a Face in <sic>Swadling-Clouts</sic> to hers. Her Skin hung in Reaves like a Bag of Tripe. By a fair
                    Computation, one might have justly thought it would have contain’d three such
                    Carcasses as hers then was. She had one of her Hands contracted by some Accident
                    in the Fire, they <pb n="30" xml:id="p30"/> sleeping always by it, and often
                    fall into sad Disasters, especially in their drunken Moods. I made the strictest
                    Enquiry that was possible, and by what I could gather, she was considerably
                    above 100 Years old, notwithstanding she smoak’d Tobacco, and eat her Victuals,
                    to all Appearance, as heartily as one of 18. One of our Company spoke some of
                    their Language, and having not quite forgotten his former Intrigues with the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Lasses, would fain have been dealing with some of
                    the young Female Fry; but they refus’d him, he having nothing that these Girls
                    esteem’d. At Night we were laid in the King’s Cabin, where the Queen and the old <sic>Squah</sic> pig’d in with us: The former was very much disfigur’d with Tettars,
                    and very reserv’d, which disappointed our fellow Traveller in his Intrigues.</p>
                <p n="69">The Women smoak much Tobacco, (as most <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> do.) They
                    have Pipes, whose Heads are cut out of Stone, and will hold an Ounce of Tobacco,
                    and some much less. They have large wooden Spoons, as big as small Ladles, which
                    they make little Use of, lading the Meat out of the Bowls with their
                    Fingers.</p>

                    on our Way; but it was too soon for him to stir out, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> never setting forward ’till the Sun is an Hour or two high,
                    and hath exhall’d the Dew from the Earth. The Queen got us a good Breakfast
                    before we left her; she had a young Child, which was much afflicted with the <sic>Cholick</sic>; for which Distemper she infus’d a Root in Water, which was held in a <sic>Goard</sic>; this she took into her Mouth, and spurted it into the Infant’s, which
                    gave it ease. After we had eaten, we set out (with our new Guide) for the <hi rend="italics">Wateree Indians.</hi> We went over a great deal of
                    indifferent Land this Day. Here begins to appear very good Marble, which
                    continues more and less for the Space of 500 Miles. We lay all Night by a Run of
                    Water, as we always do, (if possible) for the Convenience of it. The Weather was
                    very cold. We went this Day about 30 Miles from the <hi rend="italics">Congerees.</hi></p>

                    the Land increasing in Marble and <pb n="31" xml:id="p31"/> Richness of Soil. At
                    Noon we halted, getting our Dinner upon a Marble-Stone, that rose it self half a
                    Foot above the Surface of the Earth, and might contain the Compass of a Quarter
                    of an Acre of Land, being very even, there growing upon it in some Places a
                    small red Berry, like a Salmon-Spawn, there boiling out of the main Rock curious
                    Springs of as delicious Water, as ever I drank in any Parts I ever travell’d
                    in.</p>
                <p n="72">These Parts likewise affords good free Stone, fit for Building, and of several
                    Sorts. The Land here is pleasantly seated, with pretty little Hills and Valleys,
                    the rising Sun at once shewing his glorious reflecting Rays on a great many of
                    these little Mountains. We went this Day about 20 Miles, our Guide walking like
                    a Horse, till we had sadl’d him with a good heavy Pack of some Part of our
                    Cloaths and Bedding; by which Means we kept Pace with him.</p>
                <p n="73">This Night we lay by a Run-side, where I found a fine yellow Earth, the same with
                    Bruxels-Sand, which Goldsmiths use to cast withal, giving a good Price in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and other Parts. Here is likewise the true
                    Blood-Stone, and considerable Quantities of Fullers-Earth, which I took a Proof
                    of, by scouring great Spots out of Woollen, and it prov’d very good.</p>

                <p n="74">As we were on our Road this Morning, our <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> shot at a
                    Tyger, that cross’d the Way, he being a great Distance from us. I believe he did
                    him no Harm, because he fat on his Breech afterwards, and look’d upon us. I
                    suppose he expected to have had a Spaniel Bitch, that I had with me, for his
                    Breastfast, who run towards him, but in the Midway <sic>stopt</sic> her Career, and came sneaking back to us with her Tail betwixt her
                    Legs.</p>
                <p n="75">We saw in the Path a great many Trees blown up by the Roots, at the Bottom
                    whereof stuck great Quantities of fine red Bole; I believe nothing inferior to
                    that of <hi rend="italics">Venice</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Lemma.</hi> We
                    found some Holes in the Earth, which were full of a Water as black as Ink. I
                    thought that Tincture might proceed from some Mineral, but had not Time to make
                    a farther Discovery. About Noon we pass’d over a pleasant <pb n="32" xml:id="p32"/> stony Brook, whose Water was of a bluish Cast, as it is for
                    several hundreds of Miles towards the Heads of the Rivers, I suppose occasion’d
                    by the vast Quantities of Marble lying in the Bowels of the Earth. The Springs
                    that feed these Rivulets, lick up some Potions of the Stones in the Brooks;
                    which Dissolution gives this Tincture, as appears in all, or most of the Rivers
                    and Brooks of this Country, whose rapid Streams are like those in <hi rend="italics">Yorkshire,</hi> and other <hi rend="italics">Northern</hi>
                    Counties of <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    talk of many Sorts of Fish which they afford, but we had not Time to discover
                    their Species.</p>
                <p n="76">I saw here had been some <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Plantations formerly,
                    there being several pleasant Fields of clear’d Ground, and excellent Soil, now
                    well spread with fine bladed Grass, and Strawberry-Vines.</p>
                <p n="77">The Mould here is excessive rich, and a Country very pleasing to the Eye, had it
                    the Convenience of a navigable River, as all new Colonies (of Necessity)
                    require. It would make a delightful Settlement.</p>
                <p n="78">We went eight Miles farther, and came to the <hi rend="italics">Wateree Chickanee
                        Indians.</hi> The Land holds good, there being not a Spot of bad Land to be
                    seen in several Days going.</p>
                <p n="79">The People of this Nation are likely tall Persons, and great Pilferers, stealing
                    from us any Thing they could lay their Hands on, though very respectful in
                    giving us what Victuals we wanted. We lay in their Cabins all Night, being dark
                    smoaky Holes, as ever I saw any <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> dwell in. This
                    Nation is much more populous than the <hi rend="italics">Congerees,</hi> and
                    their Neighbours, yet understand not one <sic>anothers</sic> Speech. They are very poor in <hi rend="italics">English Effects,</hi>
                    several of them having no Guns, making Use of Bows and Arrows, being a lazy idle
                    People, a Quality incident to most <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> but none to
                    that Degree as these, as I ever met withal.</p>
                <p n="80">Their Country is wholly free from Swamps and Quagmires, being high dry Land, and
                    consequently healthful, producing large Corn-Stalks, and fair Grain.</p>

                <p n="81">Next Morning, we took off our Beards with a Razor, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> looking on with a great deal of Admiration. They told us, they
                    had never seen the like before, and that our Knives cut far better than those
                    that came amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> They would fain have
                    borrow’d our Razors, as they had our Knives, Scissors, and Tobacco-Tongs, the
                    day before, being as ingenious at picking of Pockets, as any, I believe, the
                    World affords; for they will steal with their Feet. Yesterday, one of our
                    Company, not walking so fast as the rest, was left behind. He being out of Sight
                    before we miss’d him, and not coming up to us, tho’ we staid a considerable time
                    on the Road for him, we stuck up Sticks in the Ground, and left other Tokens to
                    direct him which way we were gone: But he came not to us that Night, which gave
                    us Occasion to fear some of the Heathens had kill’d him, for his Cloaths, or the
                    savage Beasts had devour’d him in the Wilderness, he having nothing about him to
                    strike Fire withal. As we were debating which way we should send to know what
                    was become of him, he overtook us, having a <hi rend="italics">Waxsaw
                        Indian</hi> for his Guide. He told us, he had miss’d the Path, and got to
                    another Nation of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> but 3 Miles off, who at that
                    time held great Feasting. They had entertain’d him very respectfully, and sent
                    that <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> to invite us amongst them, <sic>wondring</sic> that we would not take up our Quarters with them, but make our Abode
                    with such a poor Sort of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that were not capable
                    of entertaining us according to our Deserts: We receiv’d the Messenger with a
                    great many Ceremonies, acceptable to those sort of Creatures. Bidding our <hi rend="italics">Waterree</hi> King adieu, we set forth towards the <hi rend="italics">Waxsaws,</hi> going along clear’d Ground all the Way. Upon
                    our Arrival, we were led into a very large and lightsome Cabin, the like I have
                    not met withal. They laid Furs and Deer-Skins upon Cane Benches for us to sit or
                    lie upon, bringing (immediately) stewed Peaches and green Corn, that is
                    preserv’d in their Cabins before it is ripe, and sodden and boil’d when they use
                    it, which is a pretty sort of Food, and a great Increaser of the Blood.</p>
                <p n="82">These <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are of an extraordinary Stature, and call’d
                    by their Neighbours flat Heads, which seems a very suitable Name for them. In
                    their Infancy, their Nurses lay the Back-part of their Children’s Heads on a Bag
                    of Sand, (such <pb n="34" xml:id="p34"/> as Engravers use to rest their Plates
                    upon.) They use a Roll, which is placed upon the Babe’s Forehead, it being laid
                    with its Back on a flat Board, and swaddled hard down thereon, from one End of
                    this Engine, to the other. This Method makes the Child’s Body and Limbs as
                    straight as an Arrow. There being some young <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    that are perhaps crookedly inclin’d, at their first coming into the World, who
                    are made perfectly straight by this Method. I never saw an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> of a mature Age, that was any ways crooked, except by Accident,
                    and that way seldom, for they cure and prevent Deformities of the Limbs, and
                    Body, very exactly. The Instrument I spoke of before, being a sort of a Press,
                    that is let out and in, more or less, according to the Discretion of the Nurse,
                    in which they make the Child’s Head flat, it makes the Eyes stand a prodigious
                    Way asunder, and the Hair hang over the Forehead like the Eves of a House, which
                    seems very frightful: They being ask’d the Reason why they practs’d this Method,
                    reply’d, the <hi rend="italics">Indian’s</hi> Sight was much strengthened and
                    quicker, thereby, to discern the Game in hunting at larger Distance, and so
                    never miss’d of becoming expert Hunters, the Perfection of which they all aim
                    at, as we do to become experienced Soldiers, learned School-Men, or Artists in <sic>Mechanicks</sic>: He that is a good Hunter never misses of being a Favourite amongst
                    the Women; the prettiest Girls being always bestow’d upon the chiefest
                    Sports-Men, and those of a grosser Mould, upon the useless <hi rend="italics">Lubbers.</hi> Thus they have a Graduation amongst them, as well as other
                    Nations. As for the Solemnity of Marriages amongst them, kept with so much
                    Ceremony as divers Authors affirm, it never appear’d amongst those many Nations
                    I have been withal, any otherwise than in the Manner I have mention’d
                    hereafter.</p>
                <p n="83">The Girls at 12 or 13 Years of Age, as soon as Nature prompts them, freely bestow
                    their Maidenheads on some Youth about the same Age, continuing her Favours on
                    whom she most affects, changing her Mate very often, few or none of them being
                    constant to one, till a greater Number of Years has made her capable of managing
                    Domestick Affairs, and she hath try’d the Vigour of most of the Nation she
                    belongs to; Multiplicity of Gallants never being a Stain to a Female’s
                    Reputation, or the least Hindrance of her Advancement, <pb n="35" xml:id="p35"/>
                    but the more <hi rend="italics">Whorish,</hi> the more <hi rend="italics">Honourable,</hi> and they of all most coveted, by those of the first Rank,
                    to make a Wife of. The <hi rend="italics">Flos Virginis,</hi> so much coveted by
                    the <hi rend="italics">Europeans,</hi> is never valued by these Savages. When a
                    Man and Woman have gone through their Degrees, (there being a certain Graduation
                    amongst them) and are allow’d to be House-Keepers, which is not till they arrive
                    at such an Age, and have past the Ceremonies practis’d by their Nation, almost
                    all Kingdoms differing in the Progress thereof, then it is that the Man makes
                    his Addresses to some one of these thorough-paced Girls, or other, whom he likes
                    best. When she is won, the Parents of both Parties, (with Advice of the King)
                    agree about the Matter, making a Promise of their Daughter, to the Man, that
                    requires her, it often happening that they converse and travel together, for
                    several Moons before the Marriage is publish’d openly; After this, at the least
                    Dislike the Man may turn her away, and take another; or if she disapproves of
                    his Company, a Price is set upon her, and if the Man that seeks to get her, will
                    pay the Fine to her Husband, she becomes free from Him: Likewise some of their
                    War Captains, and great Men, very often will retain 3 or 4 Girls at a time for
                    their own Use, when at the same time, he is so impotent and old, as to be
                    incapable of making Use of one of them; so that he seldom misses of wearing
                    greater Horns than the Game he kills. The Husband is never so enrag’d as to put
                    his Adulteress to Death; if she is caught in the Fact, the Rival becomes Debtor
                    to the cornuted Husband, in a certain Quantity of Trifles valuable amongst them,
                    which he pays as soon as discharg’d, and then all Animosity is laid aside <sic>bewixt</sic> the Husband, and his Wife’s Gallant. The Man proves often so good
                    humour’d as to please his Neighbour and gratify his Wife’s Inclinations, by
                    letting her out for a Night or two, to the Embraces of some other, which perhaps
                    she has a greater Liking to, tho’ this is not commonly practis’d.</p>
                <p n="84">They set apart the youngest and prettiest Faces for trading Girls; these are
                    remarkable by their Hair, having a particular Tonsure by which they are known,
                    and distinguish’d from those engag’d to Husbands. They are mercenary, and
                    whoever makes Use of them, first hires them, the greatest Share of the Gain
                    going to the King’s Purse, who is the chief Bawd, exercising his <sic>Perogative</sic> over all the Stews of his Nation, and <pb n="36" xml:id="p36"/> his
                    own Cabin (very often) being the chiefest Brothel-House. As they grown in Years,
                    the hot Assaults of Love grow cooler; and then they commonly are so staid, as to
                    engage themselves with more Constancy to each other. I have seen several Couples
                    amongst them, that have been so reserv’d, as to live together for many Years,
                    faithful to each other, admitting none to their Beds but such as they own’d for
                    their Wife or Husband: So continuing to their Life’s end.</p>
                <p n="85">At our <hi rend="italics">Waxsaw</hi> Landlord’s Cabin, was a Woman employ’d in
                    no other Business than Cookery; it being a House of great Resort. The Fire was
                    surrounded with Roast-meat, or <hi rend="italics">Barbakues,</hi> and the Pots
                    continually boiling full of Meat, from Morning till Night. This She-Cook was the
                    cleanliest I ever saw amongst the Heathens of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi>
                    washing her Hands before she undertook to do any Cookery; and repeated this
                    unusual Decency very often in a day. She made us as White-Bread as any <hi rend="italics">English</hi> could have done, and was full as neat, and
                    expeditious, in her Affairs. It happen’d to be one of their great Feasts, when
                    we were there: The first day that we came amongst them, arriv’d an Ambassador
                    from the King of <hi rend="italics">Sapona,</hi> to treat with these <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> about some important Affairs. He was painted
                    with <sic>Vermillion</sic> all over his Face, having a very large Cutlass stuck in his Girdle,
                    and a Fusee in his Hand. At Night, the Revels began where this Foreign <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> was admitted; the King, and War Captain, inviting
                    us to see their Masquerade: This Feast was held in Commemoration of the
                    plentiful Harvest of Corn they had reap’d the Summer before, with an united
                    Supplication for the like plentiful Produce the Year ensuing. These Revels are
                    carried on in a House made for that purpose, it being done round with white
                    Benches of fine Canes, joining along the Wall; and a place for the Door being
                    left, which is so low, that a Man must stoop very much to enter therein. This
                    Edifice resembles a large Hay Rick; its Top being Pyramidal, and much bigger
                    than their other Dwellings, and at the Building whereof, every one assist till
                    it is finish’d. All their Dwelling-Houses are cover’d with Bark, but this
                    differs very much; for, it is very artificially thatch’d with Sedge and Rushes:
                    As soon as finish’d, they place some one of their chiefest Men to dwell therein,
                    charging him with the diligent Preservation thereof, as a Prince commits the
                    Charge <pb n="37" xml:id="p37"/> and Government of a Fort or Castle, to some
                    Subject he thinks worthy of that Trust. In these State-Houses is transacted all
                    Publick and Private Business, relating to the Affairs of the Government, as the
                    Audience of Foreign Ambassadors from other <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    Rulers, Consultation of waging and making War, Proposals of their Trade with
                    neighbouring <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> or the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> who happen to come amongst them. In this Theater, the most
                    Aged and Wisest meet, determining what to Act, and what may be most convenient
                    to Omit, Old Age being held in as great Veneration amongst these Heathens, as
                    amongst any People you shall meet withal in any Part of the World.</p>
                <p n="86">Whensoever an Aged Man is speaking, none ever interrupts him, (the contrary
                    Practice the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and other <hi rend="italics">Europeans,</hi> too much use) the Company yielding a great deal of
                    Attention to his Tale, with a continued Silence, and an exact Demeanour, during
                    the Oration. Indeed, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are a People that never
                    interrupt one another in their Discourse; no Man so much as offering to open his
                    Mouth, till the Speaker has utter’d his Intent: When an <hi rend="italics">English</hi>-Man comes amongst them, perhaps every one is acquainted with
                    him, yet, first, the King bids him Welcome, after him the War-Captain, so on
                    gradually from High to Low; not one of all these speaking to the White Guest,
                    till his Superiour has ended his Salutation. Amongst Women, it seems impossible
                    to find a Scold; if they are provok’d, or affronted, by their Husbands, or some
                    other, they resent the Indignity offer’d them in silent Tears, or by refusing
                    their Meat. Would some of our <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Daughters of
                    Thunder set these <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> for a Pattern, there might be
                    more quiet Families found amongst them, occasion’d by that unruly Member, the
                    Tongue.</p>
                <p n="87"><hi rend="italics">Festination</hi> proceeds from the Devil, (<hi rend="italics">says a Learned</hi> Doctor) a Passion the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    seem wholly free from; they determining no Business of Moment, without a great
                    deal of Deliberation and Wariness. None of their Affairs appear to be attended
                    with Impetuosity, or Haste, being more content with the common Accidents
                    incident to humane Nature, (as Losses, contrary Winds, bad Weather, and Poverty)
                    than those of more civilized Countries.</p>
                <p n="88">Now, to return to our State-House, whither we were invited by the Grandees: As
                    soon as we came into it, they plac’d <pb n="38" xml:id="p38"/> our <hi rend="italics">Englishmen</hi> near the King; it being my Fortune to sit
                    next him, having his great General, or War-Captain, on my other Hand. The House
                    is as dark as a Dungeon, and as hot as one of the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi>-Stoves in <hi rend="italics">Holland.</hi> They had made a circular
                    Fire of split Canes in the middle of the House. It was one Man’s Employment to
                    add more split Reeds to the one end as it consum’d at the other, there being a
                    small Vacancy left to supply it with <sic>Fewel</sic>. They brought in great store of Loblolly, and other Medleys, made of
                        <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Grain, stewed Peaches, Bear-Venison, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> every one bringing some Offering to enlarge the
                    Banquet, according to his Degree and Quality. When all the <hi rend="italics">Viands</hi> were brought in, the first Figure began with kicking out the
                    Dogs, which are seemingly Wolves, made tame with starving and beating; they
                    being the worst Dog-Masters in the World; so that it is an infallible Cure for
                    Sore-Eyes, ever to see an <hi rend="italics">Indian’s</hi> Dog fat. They are of
                    a quite contrary Disposition to Horses; some of their Kings having gotten, by
                    great chance, a Jade, stolen by some neighbouring <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> and transported farther into the Country, and fold; or bought
                    sometimes of a <hi rend="italics">Christian,</hi> that trades amongst them.
                    These Creatures they continually cram, and seed with Maiz, and what the Horse
                    will eat, till he is as fat as a Hog; never making any farther use of him than
                    to fetch a Deer home, that is killed somewhere near the <hi rend="italics">Indian’s</hi> Plantation.</p>
                <p n="89">After the Dogs had sled the Room, the Company was summon’d by Beat of Drum; the
                    Musick being made of a dress’d Deer’s Skin, tied hard upon an Earthen
                    Porridge-Pot. Presently in came fine Men dress’d up with Feathers, their Faces
                    being covered with Vizards made of Gourds; round their <sic>Ancles</sic> and Knees, were hung Bells of several sorts, having Wooden Falchions
                    in their Hands, (such as Stage-Fencers commonly use;) in this Dress they danced
                    about an Hour, shewing many strange Gestures, and brandishing their Wooden
                    Weapons, as if they were going to fight each other; oftentimes walking very
                    nimbly round the Room, without making the least Noise with their Bells, (a thing
                    I much admired at;) again, turning their Bodies, Arms and Legs, into such
                    frightful Postures, that you would have guess’d they had been quite raving mad:
                    At last, they cut two or three high Capers, and left the Room. In their stead,
                    came in a parcel <pb n="39" xml:id="p39"/> of Women and Girls, to the Number of
                    Thirty odd; every one taking place according to her Degree of Stature, the
                    tallest leading the Dance, and the least of all being plac’d last; with these
                    they made a circular Dance, like a Ring, representing the Shape of the Fire they
                    danced about: Many of these had great Horse-Bells about their Legs, and small
                    Hawk’s Bells about their Necks. They had Musicians, who were two Old Men, one of
                    whom beat a Drum, while the other rattled with a Gourd, that had Corn in it, to
                    make a Noise withal: To these Instruments, they both sung a mournful Ditty; the
                    Burthen of their Song was, in Remembrance of their former Greatness, and Numbers
                    of their Nation, the famous Exploits of their Renowned Ancestors, and all
                    Actions of Moment that had (in former Days) been perform’d by their Forefathers.
                    At these Festivals it is, that they give a Traditional Relation of what hath
                    pass’d amongst them, to the younger Fry. These verbal Deliveries being always
                    publish’d in their most Publick Assemblies, serve instead of our Traditional
                    Notes, by the use of Letters. Some <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that I have
                    met withal, have given me a very curious Description of the great Deluge, the
                    Immortality of the Soul, with a pithy Account of the Reward of good and wicked
                    Deeds in the Life to come; having found, amongst some of them, great Observers
                    of Moral Rules, and the Law of Nature; indeed, a worthy Foundation to build
                    Christianity upon, were a true Method found out, and practis’d, for the
                    Performance thereof.</p>
                <p n="90">Their way of Dancing, is nothing but a sort of stamping Motion, much like the
                    treading upon Founders Bellows. This Female-Gang held their Dance for above fix
                    Hours, being all of them of a white Lather, like a Running Horse that has just
                    come in from his Race. My Landlady was the Ringleader of the <hi rend="italics">Amazons,</hi> who, when in her own House, behav’d herself very discreetly,
                    and warily, in her Domestick Affairs; yet, Custom had so infatuated her, as to
                    almost break her Heart with Dancing amongst such a confused Rabble. During this
                    Dancing, the Spectators do not neglect their Business, in working the
                    Loblolly-Pots, and the other Meat that was brought thither; more or less of them
                    being continually Eating, whilst the others were Dancing. When the Dancing was
                    ended, every Youth that was so disposed, catch’d <pb n="40" xml:id="p40"/> hold
                    of the Girl he liked best, and took her that Night for his Bed-Fellow, making as
                    short Courtship and expeditious Weddings, as the Foot-Guards us’d to do with the
                        <hi rend="italics">Trulls</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Salisbury-Court.</hi></p>
                <p n="91">Next we shall treat of the Land hereabouts, which is a Marl as red as Blood, and
                    will lather like Soap. The Town stands on this Land, which holds considerably
                    farther in the Country, and is in my Opinion, so durable that no Labour of Man,
                    in one or two Ages, could make it poor. I have formerly seen the like in <hi rend="italics">Leicestershire,</hi> bordering upon <hi rend="italics">Rutland.</hi> Here were Corn-Stalks in their Fields as thick as the Small
                    of a Man’s Leg, and they are ordinarily to be seen.</p>
                <p n="92">We lay with these <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> one Night, there being by my
                    Bed-side one of the largest Iron Pots I had ever seen in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> which I much <sic>wondred</sic> at, because I thought there might be no navigable Stream near that
                    Place. I ask’d them, where they got that Pot? They laugh’d at my Demand, and
                    would give me no Answer, which makes me guess it came from some Wreck, and that
                    we were nearer the Ocean, or some great River, than I thought.</p>

                        Indian,</hi> amongst those that us’d to trade backwards and forwards, and
                    spoke a little <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> whom we hir’d to go with us to
                    the <hi rend="italics">Esam Indians,</hi> a very large Nation containing many
                    thousand People. In the Afternoon we set forward, taking our Leaves of the <hi rend="italics">Wisack Indians,</hi> and leaving them some Trifles. On our
                    Way, we met with several Towns of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> each Town
                    having its Theater or State House, such Houses being found all along the <sic>Road,till</sic> you come to <hi rend="italics">Sapona,</hi>and then no more of those
                    Buildings, it being about 170 Miles. We reach’d 10 Miles this day, lying at
                    another Town of the <hi rend="italics">Wisacks.</hi> The Man of the House
                    offer’d us Skins to sell, but they were too heavy Burdens for our long

                <p n="94">Next Morning we set out early, breaking the Ice we met withal, in the stony Runs,
                    which were many. We pass’d by several Cottages, and about 8 of the Clock came to
                    a pretty big Town, where we took up our Quarters, in one of their State Houses,
                    the Men being all out, hunting in the Woods, and none but Women at home. Our
                    Fellow Traveller of whom I spoke before at the <hi rend="italics">Congerees,</hi> having a great Mind for an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    Lass, for his Bed-Fellow that Night, <pb n="41" xml:id="p41"/> spoke to our
                    Guide, who soon got a Couple, reserving one for himself. That which fell to our
                    Companion’s Share, was a pretty young Girl. Tho’ they could not understand one
                    Word of what each other spoke, yet the Female <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi>
                    being no Novice at her Game, but understanding what she came thither for, acted
                    her Part dexterously enough with her Cully, to make him sensible of what she
                    wanted; which was to pay the Hire, before he rode the Hackney. He shew’d her all
                    the Treasure he was possess’d of, as Beads, Red Cadis, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> which she lik’d very well, and permitted him to put them into
                    his Pocket again, endearing him with all the Charms, which one of a better
                    Education than Dame Nature had Bestow’d upon <sic>her,could</sic> have made use <sic>of,to</sic> render her Consort a surer Captive. After they had us’d this Sort of
                    Courtship a small time, the Match was confirm’d by both Parties, with the
                    Approbation of as many <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Women, as came to the
                    House, to celebrate our <hi rend="italics">Winchester</hi>-Wedding. Every one of
                    the Bride-Maids were as great Whores, as Mrs. Bride, tho’ not quite so handsome.
                    Our happy Couple went to Bed together before us <sic>all,and</sic> with as little Blushing, as if they had been Man and Wife for 7 Years.
                    The rest of the Company being weary with travelling, had more Mind to take their
                    Rest, than add more Weddings to that hopeful one already consummated; so that
                    tho’ the other Virgins offer’d their Service to us, we gave them their Answer,
                    and went to sleep. About an Hour before day, I awak’d, and saw somebody walking
                    up and down the Room in a seemingly deep Melancholy. I call’d out to know who it
                    was, and it prov’d to be Mr. Bridegroom, who in less than 12 Hours, was <sic>Batchelor</sic>, Husband, and <sic>Widdower</sic>, his dear Spouse having pick’d his Pocket of the Beads, Cadis, and
                    what else should have gratified the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> for the
                    Victuals we receiv’d of them. However that did not serve her<sic> turn,but</sic> she had also got his Shooes away, which he had made the Night before,
                    of a drest Buck-Skin. Thus dearly did our Spark already repent his new Bargain,
                    walking bare-foot, in his Penitentials, like some poor Pilgrim to <hi rend="italics">Loretto.</hi></p>
                <p n="95">After the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had laugh’d their Sides sore at the
                    Figure Mr. Bridegroom made, with much ado, we muster’d up another Pair of
                    Shooes, or <sic><hi rend="italics">Moggisons,</hi></sic> and set forward on our intended Voyage, the Company (all the way)
                    lifting up their <pb n="42" xml:id="p42"/> Prayers for the new married Couple,
                    whose Wedding had made away with that, which should have purchas’d our Food.</p>

                    the new-married Man. The Land held rich and good; in many Places there were
                    great Quantities of Marble. The Water was still of a wheyish Colour. About 10 of
                    the Clock, we waded thro’ a River, (about the Bigness of <hi rend="italics">Derwent,</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Torkshire</hi>) which I take to be one
                    of the Branches of <hi rend="italics">Winjaw</hi> River. We saw several Flocks
                    of Pigeons, Field-Fares, and Thrushes, much like those of <hi rend="italics">Europe.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of these Parts use
                    Sweating very much. If any Pain seize their Limbs, or Body, immediately they

                    an extraordinary Heat: There is a Pot of Water in the <hi rend="italics">Bagnio,</hi>in which is put a Bunch of an Herb, bearing a Silver Tassel,
                    not much unlike the <hi rend="italics">Aurea Virga.</hi> With this Vegetable
                    they rub the Head, Temples, and other Parts, which is reckon’d a Preserver of
                    the Sight and Strengthener of the Brain. We went, this day, about 12 Miles, one
                    of our Company being same of his Knee. We pass’d over an exceeding rich Tract of
                    Land, affording Plenty of great free Stones, and marble Rocks, and abounding in
                    many pleasant and delightsome Rivulets. At Noon, we stay’d and refresh’d
                    ourselves at a Cabin, where we met with one of their War-Captains, a Man of
                    great Esteem among them. At his Departure from the Cabin, the Man of the House
                    scratch’d this War-Captain on the Shoulder, which is look’d upon as a very great
                    Compliment among them. The Captain went two or three Miles on our way, with us,
                    to direct us in our Path. One of our Company gave him a Belt, which he took very
                    kindly, bidding us call at his House, (which was in our Road) and stay till the
                    lame Traveller was well, and speaking to the <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> to
                    order his Servant to make us welcome. Thus we parted, he being on his Journey to
                    the <hi rend="italics">Congerees,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Savannas,</hi> a
                    famous, warlike, friendly Nation of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> living to
                    the <hi rend="italics">South</hi>-End of <hi rend="italics">Ashley</hi> River.
                    He had a Man-Slave with him, who was loaded with <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Goods, his Wife and Daughter being in Company. He told us, at
                    his Departure, that <hi rend="italics">James</hi> had sent Knots to all the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> thereabouts, for <pb n="43" xml:id="p43"/> every
                    Town to send in 10 Skins, meaning Captain <hi rend="italics">Moor,</hi> then
                    Governour of <hi rend="italics">South-Carolina.</hi> The Towns being very thick
                    hereabouts, at Night we took up our Quarters at one of the chief Mens Houses,
                    which was one of the Theaters I spoke of before. There ran, hard-by this Town, a
                    pleasant River, not very large, but, as the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> told
                    us, well stor’d with Fish. We being now among the powerful Nation of <hi rend="italics">Esaws,</hi> our Landlord entertain’d us very courteously,
                    shewing us, that Night, a pair of Leather-Gloves, which he had made; and
                    comparing them with ours, they prov’d to be very ingeniously done, considering
                    it was the first Tryal.</p>

                <p n="97">In the Morning, he desired to see the lame Man’s affected Part, to the end he
                    might do something, which (he believ’d) would give him Ease. After he had viewed
                    it accordingly, he pull’d out an Instrument, somewhat like a Comb, which was
                    made of a split Reed, with 15 Teeth of Rattle-Snakes set at much the same
                    distance, as in a large Horn-Comb: With these he scratch’d the place where the
                    Lameness chiefly lay, till the Blood came, bathing it, both before and after
                    Incision, with warm Water, spurted out of his Mouth. This done, he ran into his
                    Plantation, and got some <hi rend="italics">Sassafras</hi> Root, (which grows
                    here in great plenty) dry’d it in the Embers, scrap’d off the outward Rind, and
                    having beat it betwixt two Stones, apply’d it to the Part afflicted, binding it
                    up well. Thus, in a day or two, the Patient became sound. This day, we pass’d
                    through a great many Towns, and Settlements, that belong to the <hi rend="italics">Sugeree-Indians,</hi> no barren Land being found amongst
                    them, but great plenty of Free-Stone, and good Timber. About three in the
                    Afternoon, we reach’d the <hi rend="italics">Kadapau</hi> King’s House, where we
                    met with one <hi rend="italics">John Stewart,</hi> a <hi rend="italics">Scot,</hi> then an Inhabitant of <hi rend="italics">James</hi>-River in <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> who had traded there for many Years. Being
                    alone, and hearing that the <hi rend="italics">Sinnagers</hi> (<hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> from <hi rend="italics">Canada</hi>) were abroad
                    in that Country, he durst not venture homewards, till he saw us, having heard
                    that we were coming, above 20 days before. It is very odd, that News should sly
                    so swiftly among these People. Mr. <hi rend="italics">Stewart</hi> had left <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> ever since the <hi rend="italics">October</hi>
                    before, and had lost a day of the Week, of which we inform’d him. He had brought
                    seven Horses along with him, loaded with <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Goods
                    for the <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> and having sold most of his Cargo, <pb n="44" xml:id="p44"/> told us, if we would stay two Nights, he would go
                    along with us. Company being very acceptable, we accepted the Proposal.</p>

                    along with us. Our Landlord was King of the <hi rend="italics">Kadapau

                    Offering one of these to some of our Company, who refus’d his Kindness, his
                    Majesty flew into a violent Passion, to be thus slighted, telling the <hi rend="italics">Englishmen,</hi> they were good for nothing. Our old

                    Loser by that sort of Merchandize. It was observable, that we did not see one
                    Partridge from the <hi rend="italics">Waterrees</hi> to this place, tho’ my
                    Spaniel-Bitch, which I had with me in this Voyage, had put up a great many

                    strange Kind, having a red Circle about their Eyes, like some Pigeons that I
                    have seen, a Top-knot reaching from the Crown of their Heads, almost to the
                    middle of their Backs, and abundance of Feathers of pretty Shades and Colours.
                    They prov’d excellent Meat. Likewise, here is good store of Woodcocks, not so
                    big as those in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> the Feathers of the Breast
                    being of a Carnation-Colour, exceeding ours for Delicacy of Food. The Marble
                    here is of different Colours, some or other of the Rocks representing most
                    Mixtures, but chiefly the white having black and blue Veins in it, and some that
                    are red. This day, we met with seven heaps of Stones, being the Monuments of
                    seven <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that were slain in that place by the <hi rend="italics">S'nnagers,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Troquois.</hi> Our <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Guide added a Stone to each heap. We took up our
                    Lodgings near a Brook-side, where the <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> Man’s
                    Horses got away; and went back to the <hi rend="italics">Kadapau</hi>'s.</p>

                    might see many Millions in a Flock; they sometimes split off the Limbs of stout
                    Oaks, and other Trees, upon which they roost o’ Nights. You may find several <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Towns, of not above 17 Houses, that have more
                    than 100 Gallons of Pigeons Oil, or Fat; they using it with <pb n="45" xml:id="p45"/> Pulse, or Bread, as we do Butter, and making the Ground as
                    white as a Sheet with their Dung. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> take a
                    Light, and go among them in the Night, and bring away some thousands, killing
                    them with long Poles, as they roost in the Trees. At this time of the Year, the

                    which was, Hills and <sic>Vallies</sic>, about 10 a Clock we reach’d the Top of one of these Mountains, which
                    yielded us a fine Prospect of a very level Country, holding so, on all sides,
                    farther than we could discern. When we came to travel through it, we found it
                    very stiff and rich, being a sort of Marl. This Valley afforded as large Timber
                    as any I ever met withal, especially of <sic>Chesnut-Oaks</sic>, which render it an excellent Country for raising great Herds of
                    Swine. Indeed, were it cultivated, we might have good hopes of as pleasant and
                    fertile a Valley, as any our <hi rend="italics">English</hi> in <hi rend="italics">America</hi> can afford. At Night, we lay by a swift Current,
                    where we saw plenty of Turkies, but pearch’d upon such lofty Oaks, that our Guns
                    would not kill them, tho’ we shot very often, and our Guns were very good. Some
                    of our Company shot several times, at one Turkey, before he would fly away, the
                    Pieces being loaded with large Goose-shot.</p>

                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> beat them into Meal, and thicken their
                    Venison-Broth with them; and oftentimes make a palatable Soop. They are used
                    instead of Bread, boiling them till the Oil swims on the top of the Water, which
                    they preserve for use, eating the Acorns with Flesh-meat. We travell’d, this
                    day, about 25 Miles, over pleasant <hi rend="italics">Savanna</hi> Ground, high,
                    and dry, having very few Trees upon it, and those standing at a great distance.
                    The Land was very good, and free from Grubs or Underwood. A Man near <hi rend="italics">Sapona</hi> may more easily clear 10 Acres of Ground, than in
                    some places he can one; there being much loose Stone upon the Land, lying very
                    convenient for making of dry Walls, or any other sort of durable Fence. This

                    (navigable for small Craft) disgorging themselves into the main Rivers, that

                    of Fifth, and Fowl, and are very convenient for the Transportation of what
                    Commodities this Place may produce. This Night, we had a great deal of Rain,

                    the Horses, and the rest of the Company, and went directly for <hi rend="italics">Sapona</hi> Town. That day, we pass’d through a delicious
                    Country, (none that I ever saw exceeds it.) We saw fine bladed Grass, six Foot
                    high, along the Banks of these pleasant Rivulets: We pass’d by the Sepulchres of
                    Several slain <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> Coming, that day, about 30 Miles,
                    we reach’d the fertile and pleasant Banks of <hi rend="italics">Sapona</hi>
                    River, whereon stands the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Town and Fort. Nor

                    inhabited by <hi rend="italics">Christians,</hi> and cultivated by ingenious
                    Hands. These <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> live in a clear Field, about a Mile
                    square, which they would have fold me; because I talked something of coming into
                    those Parts to live. This most pleasant River may be something broader than the
                        <hi rend="italics">Thames</hi> at <hi rend="italics">Kingston,</hi> keeping
                    a continual pleasant warbling Noise, with its reverberating on the bright Marble
                    Rocks. It is beautified with a numerous Train of Swans, and other sorts of
                    Water-Fowl, not common, though extraordinary pleasing to the Eye. The forward
                    Spring welcom’d us with her innumerable Train of small Choristers, which inhabit
                    those fair Banks; the Hills redoubling, and adding Sweetness to their melodious
                    Tunes by their shrill Echoes. One side of the River is hemm’d in with mountainy
                    Ground, the other side proving as rich a Soil to the Eye of a knowing Person
                    with us, as any this Western World can afford. We took up our Quarters at the
                    King’s Cabin, who was a good Friend to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and
                    had lost one of his Eyes in their Vindication. Being upon his march towards the
                        <hi rend="italics"><sic>Appallatche</sic></hi> Mountains, amongst a Nation of <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> in their Way, there happen’d a Difference, while they were
                    measuring of Gun-powder; and the Powder, by accident, taking fire, blew out one
                    of this King’s Eyes, and did a great deal more mischief, upon the spot: Yet this
                        <hi rend="italics">Sapona</hi> King stood firmly to the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Man’s Interest, with whom he was in Company, still <pb n="47" xml:id="p47"/> siding with him against the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi>
                    They were intended for the <hi rend="italics">South Sea,</hi> but were too much
                    fatigued by the vast Ridge of Mountains, tho’ they hit the right Passage; it
                    being no less than five days Journey through a Ledge of Rocky Hills, and sandy
                    Deserts. And which is yet worse, there is no Water, nor scarce a Bird to be
                    seen, during your Passage over these barren Crags and Valleys. The <hi rend="italics">Sapona</hi> River proves to be the <hi rend="italics">West</hi> Branch of <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Clarendon</hi> River, whose Inlet, with other Advantages,
                    makes it appear as noble a River to plant a Colony in, as any I have met

                <p n="105">The <hi rend="italics">Saponas</hi> had (about 10 days before we came thither)
                    taken Five Prisoners of the <hi rend="italics">Sinnagers</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Jennitos,</hi> a Sort of People that range several thousands
                    of Miles, making all Prey they lay their Hands on. These are fear’d by all the
                    savage Nations I ever was among, the Westward <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    dreading their Approach. They are all forted in, and keep continual Spies and

                    was some of it in Powder; he was a notable Hunter, and affirm’d to me, That that
                    Powder, blown into the Eyes, strengthen’d the Sight and Brain exceedingly, that
                    being the most common use they made of it. I bought, for 2 or 3 Flints, a large
                    Peach-Loaf, made up with a pleasant sort of Seed; and this did us a singular
                    Kindness, in our Journey. Near the Town, within their clear’d Land, are several

                    like a large Oven. These they make much Use of; especially, for any Pains in the

                    the most violent N. W. Wind I ever knew. The puff blew down all the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Palisadoes</sic></hi> that fortify’d the Town; and I thought it would have blown us
                    all into the River, together with the Houses. Our one-ey’d King, who pretends
                    much to the Art of Conjuration, ran out in the most violent Hurry, and in the
                    Middle of the Town, fell to his Necromantick Practice; tho’ I thought he would

                    could have exchang’d half a dozen Words; but in two Minutes, the Wind was
                    ceas’d, and it became as great a Calm, as ever I knew in my Life. As I much
                    admir’d at that sudden Alteration, the old Man told me, the <hi rend="italics">Devil</hi> was very angry, and had done thus, because they had not put the

                    set out from the <hi rend="italics">Sapona-Indian</hi> Town, after having seen
                    some of the Locust, which is gotten thereabouts, the same Sort that bears Honey.
                    Going over several Creeks, very convenient for Water-Mills, about 8 Miles from
                    the Town, we pass’d over a very pretty River, call’d Rocky River, a fit Name,
                    having a Ridge of high Mountains running from its Banks, to the Eastward; and
                    disgorging itself into <hi rend="italics">Sapona</hi>-River; so that there is a
                    most pleasant and convenient Neck of Land, betwixt both Rivers, lying upon a
                    Point, where many thousand Acres may be fenced in, without <pb n="50" xml:id="p50"/> much Cost or Labour. You can scarce go a Mile, without
                    meeting with one of these small swift Currents, here being no Swamps to be
                    found, but pleasant, dry Roads all over the Country. The Way that we went this
                    day, was as full of Stones, as any which <hi rend="italics">Craven,</hi> in the
                    West of <hi rend="italics">Yorkshire,</hi> could afford, and having nothing but
                        <hi rend="italics"><sic>Moggisons</sic></hi> on my Feet, I was so lam’d by this stony Way, that I thought
                    I must have taken up some Stay in those Parts. We went, this day, not above 15
                    or 20 Miles. After we had supp’d, and all lay down to sleep, there came a Wolf
                    close to the Fire-side, where we lay. My Spaniel soon discover’d him, at which,
                    one of our Company fir’d a Gun at the Beast; but, I believe, there was a Mistake
                    in the loading of it, for it did him no Harm. The Wolf stay’d till he had almost
                    loaded again, but the Bitch making a great Noise, at last left us and went
                    aside. We had no sooner laid down, but he approach’d us again, yet was more shy,
                    so that we could not get a Shot at him.</p>

                    Land is more mountainous, but extremely pleasant, and an excellent Place for the
                    breeding Sheep, Goats, and Horses; or Mules, if the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> were once brought to the Experience of the Usefulness of those
                    Creatures. The Valleys are here very rich. At Noon, we pass’d over such another
                    stony River, as that eight Miles from <hi rend="italics">Sapona.</hi> This is
                    call’d <hi rend="italics">Heighwaree,</hi> and affords as good blue Stone for

                    than any from <hi rend="italics">Old Spain,</hi> or elsewhere. The Veins of

                    hath so fortify’d this Town, with Mountains, that were it a Seat of War, it

                    these Mountains, that is capable of keeping some hundred Heads of Cattle. And
                    all this environ’d round with very high Mountains, so that no hard Wind ever
                    troubles these Inhabitants. Those high <pb n="51" xml:id="p51"/> Clifts have no
                    Grass growing on them, and very few Trees, which are very short, and stand at a
                    great Distance one from another. The Earth is of a red Colour, and seems to me
                    to be wholly design’d by Nature for the ’Production of Minerals, being of too
                    hot a Quality, to suffer any Verdure upon its Surface. These <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> make use of Lead-Ore, to paint their Faces withal, which they

                    these Hilly Parts, I shall make a longer Stay amongst them: For were a good Vein
                    of Lead found out, and work’d by an ingenious Hand, it might be of no small
                    Advantage to the Undertaker, there being great Convenience for smelting, either
                    by Bellows or Reverberation; and the Working of these Mines might discover some

                    a Word, and gave it him to copy, which he did with more Exactness, than any <hi rend="italics">European</hi> could have done, that was illiterate. It was so

                    that Custom, the Game would leave their Country, and they should not be able to
                    maintain themselves by their Hunting. Most of these <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> wear <sic>Mustachoes</sic>, or Whiskers, which is rare; by reason the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are a People <pb n="53" xml:id="p53"/> that commonly pull the
                    Hair of their Faces, and other Parts, up by the Roots, and suffer none to grow.
                    Here is plenty of <sic>Chesnuts</sic>, which are rarely found in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and never
                    near the Sea, or Salt-Water; tho' they are frequently in such Places in <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi></p>
                <p n="116">At the other House, where our Fellow-Travellers lay, they had provided a Dish, in
                    great Fashion amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> which was Two young
                    Fawns, taken out of the Doe’s Bellies, and boil’d in the same slimy Bags Nature
                    had plac’d them in, and one of the Country-Hares, stew’d with the Guts in her
                    Belly, and her Skin with the Hair on. This new-fashion’d Cookery wrought
                    Abstinence in our Fellow-Travellers, which I somewhat wonder’d at, because one
                    of them made nothing of eating <hi rend="italics">Allegators,</hi> as heartily
                    as if it had been Pork and Turneps. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> dress
                    most things after the Wood-cock Fashion, never taking the Guts out. At the House
                    we lay at, there was very good Entertainment of Venison, Turkies, and Bears; and
                    which is customary amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> the Queen had a
                    Daughter by a former Husband, who was the beautifullest <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> I ever saw, and had an Air of Majesty with her, quite contrary
                    to the general Carriage of the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> She was very

                        <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> when they left this Place; I and one more
                    took our leaves of them, resolving (with God’s Leave) to see <hi rend="italics">North-Carolina,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> setting us
                    in our way. The rest being indifferent which way they went, desired us, by all
                    means, to leave a Letter for them, at the <hi rend="italics">Achonechy</hi>-Town. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> that put us in our
                    Path, had been a Prisoner amongst the <hi rend="italics">Sinnagers;</hi> but had
                    out-run them, although they had cut his Toes, and half his Feet away, which is a
                    Practice common amongst them. They first raise the Skin, then cut away half the
                    Feet, and so wrap the Skin over the Stumps, and make a present Cure of the
                    Wounds. This commonly disables them from making their Escape, they being not so
                    good Travellers as before, and the Impression of their Half-Feet making it easy
                    to trace them. However, this Fellow was got clear of them, but had little Heart
                    to go far from home, and carry’d always a Case of Pistols in his Girdle, besides
                    a Cutlass, and a Fuzee. <pb n="54" xml:id="p54"/> Leaving the rest of our

                    about 20 Miles, in very cold, frosty Weather; and pass’d over two pretty Rivers,
                    something bigger than <hi rend="italics">Heighwaree,</hi> but not quite so
                    stony. We took these two Rivers to make one of the Northward Branches of <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair</hi> River, but afterwards found our Mistake.</p>

                    subsist on for above 100 Miles. All the Pine-Trees were vanish’d, for we had
                    seen none for two days. We pass’d through a delicate rich Soil this day; no
                    great Hills, but pretty Risings, and Levels, which made a beautiful Country. We
                    likewise pass’d over three Rivers this day; the first about the bigness of <hi rend="italics">Rocky</hi> River, the other not much differing in Size. Then
                    we made not the least Question, but we had pass’d over the North-West Branch of
                        <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair,</hi> travelling that day above 30 Miles. We
                    were much taken with the Fertility and Pleasantness of the Neck of Land between
                    these two Branches, and no less pleas’d, that we had pass’d the River, which
                    us’d to frighten Passengers from fording it. At last, determining to rest on the
                    other side of a Hill, which we saw before us; when we were on the Top thereof,
                    there appear’d to us such another delicious, rapid Stream, as that of <hi rend="italics">Sapona,</hi> having large Stones, about the bigness of an
                    ordinary House, lying up and down the River. As the Wind blew very cold at N. W.
                    and we were very weary, and hungry, the Swiftness of the Current gave us some
                    cause to fear; but, at last, we concluded to venture over that Night.
                    Accordingly, we stripp’d, and with great Difficulty, (by God’s Assistance) got
                    safe to the North-side of the famous <hi rend="italics">Hau</hi>-River, by some
                    called <hi rend="italics">Reatkin;</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    differing in the Names of Place, according to their several Nations. It is
                    call’d <hi rend="italics">Hau</hi>-River, from the <hi rend="italics">Sissipahau
                        Indians,</hi> who dwell upon this Stream, which is one of the main Branches
                    of <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair,</hi> there being rich Land enough to contain
                    some Thousands of <pb n="55" xml:id="p55"/> Families; for which Reason, I hope,
                    in a short time, it will be planted. This River is much such another as <hi rend="italics">Sapona;</hi> both seeming to run a vast way up the Country.
                    Here is plenty of good Timber, and especially, of a Scaly-bark’d Oak; And as
                    there is Stone enough in both Rivers, and the Land is extraordinary Rich, no Man
                    that will be content within the Bounds of Reason, can have any grounds to
                    dislike it. And they that are otherwise, are the best Neighbours, when farthest

                    Town, it being, by Estimation, 20 Miles off, which, I believe, is pretty exact.
                    We were got about half way, (meeting great Gangs of Turkies) when we saw, at a
                    Distance, 30 loaded Horses, coming on the Road, with four or five Men, on other
                    Jades, driving them. We charg’d our Piece, and went up to them: Enquiring,
                    whence they came from? They told us, from <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi> The
                    leading Man’s Name was <hi rend="italics">Massey,</hi> who was born about <hi rend="italics">Leeds</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Yorkshire.</hi> He ask’d,
                    from whence we came? We told him. Then he ask’d again, Whether we wanted any
                    thing that he had? telling us, we should be welcome to it. We accepted of Two
                    Wheaten <sic>Biskets</sic>, and a little Ammunition. He advised us, by all means, to strike down
                    the Country for <hi rend="italics"><sic>Ronoack</sic>,</hi> and not think of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> because
                    of the <hi rend="italics">Sinnagers,</hi> of whom they were afraid, tho’ so well
                    arm’d, and numerous. They persuaded us also, to call upon one <hi rend="italics">Enoe Will,</hi> as we went to <hi rend="italics">Adshusheer,</hi> for that
                    he would conduct us safe among the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> giving him
                    the Character of a very faithful <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> which we
                    afterwards found true by Experience. The <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi>-Men
                    asking our Opinion of the Country we were then in? we told them, it was a very
                    pleasant one. They were all of the same Opinion, and affirm’d, That they had
                    never seen 20 Miles of such extraordinary rich Land, lying all together, like
                    that betwixt <hi rend="italics">Hau</hi>-River and the <hi rend="italics">Achonechy</hi> Town. Having taken our Leaves of each other, we set forward;
                    and the Country, thro’ which we pass’d, was so delightful, that it gave us a
                    great deal of Satisfaction. About Three a Clock, we reach’d the Town, and the
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> presently brought us good fat Bear, and
                    Venison, which was very acceptable at that time. Their Cabins were hung with a
                    good sort of Tapestry, as fat Bear, and <sic>barbakued</sic> or dried Venison; no <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> having greater
                    Plenty <pb n="56" xml:id="p56"/> of Provisions than these. The Savages do,
                    indeed, still possess the Flower of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> enjoying only the Fag-end of that fine Country.
                    We had not been in the Town 2 Hours, when <hi rend="italics">Enoe-Will</hi> came
                    into the King’s Cabin; which was our Quarters. We ask’d him, if he would conduct
                    us to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and what he would have for his Pains;
                    he answer’d, he would go along with us, and for what he was to have, he left
                    that to our Discretion.</p>

                    to <hi rend="italics">Adshusheer.</hi> We went over a small River by <hi rend="italics">Achonechy,</hi> and in this 14 Miles, through several other
                    Streams, which empty themselves into the Branches of <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair.</hi> The stony Way made me quite lame; so that I was an Hour or
                    two behind the rest; but honest <hi rend="italics">Will</hi> would not leave me,
                    but bid me welcome when we came to his House, feasting us with hot Bread, and
                    Bears-Oil; which is <sic>wholsome</sic> Food for Travellers. There runs a pretty Rivulet by this Town. Near
                    the Plantation, I saw a prodigious overgrown Pine-Tree, having not seen any of
                    that Sort of Timber for above 125 Miles: They brought us 2 Cocks, and pull’d
                    their larger Feathers off, never plucking the lesser, but singeing them off. I
                    took one of these Fowls in my Hand, to make it cleaner than the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> had, pulling out his Guts and Liver, which I laid
                    in a <sic>Bason</sic>; notwithstanding which, he kept such a Struggling for a considerable
                    time, that I had much ado to hold him in my Hands. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> laugh’d at me, and told me, that <hi rend="italics">Enoe-Will</hi> had taken a Cock of an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> that
                    was not at home, and the Fowl was design’d for another Use. I conjectur’d, that
                    he was design’d for an Offering to their God, who, they say, hurts them, (which
                    is the Devil.) In this Struggling, he bled afresh, and there issued out of his
                    Body more Blood than commonly such Creatures afford. Notwithstanding all this,
                    we cook’d him, and eat him; and if he was design’d for him, cheated the Devil.
                    The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> keep many Cocks, but seldom above one Hen,
                    using very often such wicked Sacrifices, as I mistrusted this Fowl was design’d
                    for.</p>

                    to promise him to revenge his Death, if it should so happen. He brought some of

                    other indifferent Soil. In our way, there stood a great Stone about the Size of
                    a large Oven, and hollow; this the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> took great
                    Notice of, putting some Tobacco into the Concavity, and spitting after it. I
                    ask’d them the reason of their so doing, but they made me no Answer. In the

                    them of the other I could not learn. They were not so free to us, as most of the
                    other <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had been; Victuals being somewhat scarce
                    among them. However, we got enough to satisfy our Appetites. I saw, among these
                    Men, very long Arrows, headed with Pieces of <pb n="58" xml:id="p58"/> Glass,
                    which they had broken from Bottles. They had shap’d them neatly, like the Head
                    of a Dart; but which way they did it, I can’t tell. We had not been at this Town
                    above an Hour, when two of our Company, that had bought a Mare of <hi rend="italics">John Stewart,</hi> came up to us, having receiv’d a Letter by
                    one of <hi rend="italics">Will’s Indians,</hi> who was very cautious, and asked
                    a great many Questions, to <sic>certifie</sic> him of the Person, e’er he would deliver the Letter. They had left the
                    Trader, and one that came from <hi rend="italics">South-Carolina</hi> with us,
                    to go to <hi rend="italics">Virginia;</hi> these Two being resolved to go to <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> with us.</p>

                    having curious Tracts of good Land, the Banks high, and Stone-Quarries. The <hi rend="italics">Tufkeruros</hi> being come to us, we ventur’d over the River,
                    which we found to be a strong Current, and the Water about Breast-high. However,

                    bears no Timber, but small shrubby Oaks. We went about 10 Miles, and fat down at
                    the Falls of a large Creek, where lay mighty <sic>Rocks,the</sic> Water making a strange Noise, as if a great many Water-Mills <pb n="59" xml:id="p59"/> were going at once.

                    invited him to become a Christian. He made me a very sharp Reply, assuring me,
                    That he lov’d the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> extraordinary well, and did
                    believe their Ways to be very good for those that had already practs’d them, and
                    had been brought up therein; But as for himself, he was too much in Years to
                    think of a Change, esteeming it not proper for Old People to admit of such an
                    Alteration. However, he told me, If I would take his Son <hi rend="italics">Jack,</hi> who was then about 14 Years of Age, and teach him to talk in
                    that Book, and make Paper speak, which they call our Way of Writing, he would
                    wholly resign him to my Tuition; telling me, he was of Opinion, I was very well

                    them, who was very cunning and circumspect, wheresoever he saw any Marks of
                    Footing, or of any Fire that had been made; going out of his Way, very often, to
                    look for these Marks. We went, this day, above 30 Miles, over a very level
                    Country, and most Pine Land, yet intermix’d with some Quantities of Marble; a
                    good Range for <sic>Cattel</sic>, though very indifferent for Swine. We had now lost our rapid Streams,
                    and were come to slow, dead Waters, of a brown Colour, proceeding from the <hi rend="italics">Swamps,</hi> much like the Sluices in <hi rend="italics">Holland,</hi> where the Track-<hi rend="italics">Scoots</hi> go along. In
                    the Afternoon, we met two <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruros,</hi> who told us, That
                    there was a Company of Hunters not far of, and if we walk’d stoutly, we might
                    reach them that Night. But <hi rend="italics">Will</hi> and He that own’d the
                    Mare, being gone before, and the Old <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> tired, we
                    rested, that Night, in the Woods, making a good light Fire, Wood being very

                    with about 500 <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruros</hi> in one Hunting-Quarter. They
                    had made themselves Streets of Houses, built with Pine-Bark, not with round
                    Tops, as they commonly use, but Ridge-Fashion, after the manner of most other
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> We got nothing amongst them but Corn, Flesh
                    being not plentiful, by reason of the great Number of their People. For tho'
                    they are expert Hunters, yet they are too populous for one Range; which makes
                    Venison very scarce to what it is amongst other <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi>
                    that are fewer; no Savages living so well for Plenty, as those near the Sea. I
                    saw, amongst these, a Humpback’d <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> which was the
                    only crooked one I ever met withal. About two a Clock, we reach’d one of their

                    gone to <pb n="60" xml:id="p60"/> their Hunting-Quarters. We could find no
                    Provision at that Place. We had a <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro</hi> that came in
                    company with us, from the lower Quarter, who took us to his Cabin, and gave us
                    what it afforded, which was Corn-meat.</p>

                    safe to them, himself designing, at that time, to go and fetch some Rum; so we
                    resolved to tarry for his Company. During our Stay, there happen’d to be a Young
                    Woman troubled with Fits. The Doctor who was sent for to assist her, laid her on
                    her Belly, and made a small Incision with Rattle-Snake-Teeth; then laying his
                    Mouth to the Place, he suck’d out near a Quart of black conglutinated Blood, and
                        <hi rend="italics">Serum.</hi> Our Landlord gave us the Tail of a Bever,

                    from the Planter; so that every thing seem’d to come by Nature, the Husbandman
                    living almost void of Care, and free from those Fatigues which are absolutely
                    requisite in Winter-Countries, for providing Fodder and other Necessaries; these

                        before Night, and on <hi rend="italics">Monday</hi> the 2d of <hi rend="italics">November,</hi> we came aboard our Ship. <hi rend="italics">Tuesday</hi> the 3d, we lay still, to refresh ourselves.
                        On <hi rend="italics">Wednesday</hi> the 4th, we went 5 or 6 Leagues up the
                        River, to search a Branch that run out of the main River towards the N. W.
                        In which Branch we went up 5 or 6 Leagues; but not liking the Land, return’d
                        on board that Night about Midnight, and call’d that Place <hi rend="italics">Swampy-Branch. Thursday, November</hi> the 5th; we stay’d aboard. On
                            <hi rend="italics">Friday</hi> the 6th, we went up <hi rend="italics">Greens-River,</hi> the Mouth of it being against the Place at which
                        rode our Ship. On <hi rend="italics">Saturday</hi> the 7th, we proceeded up
                        the said River <pb n="67" xml:id="p67"/> some 14 or 15 Leagues in all, and
                        found it ended in several small Branches; The Land, for the most part, being
                        marshy and Swamps, we return’d towards our Ship, and got aboard it in the
                        Night. <hi rend="italics">Sunday November</hi> the 8th, we lay still, and on
                            <hi rend="italics">Monday</hi> the 9th, went again up the main River,
                        being well stock’d with Provisions, and all things necessary, and proceeded
                        upwards till <hi rend="italics">Thursday</hi> noon, the 12th, at which time
                        we came to a Place, where were two Islands in the Middle of the River; and
                        by reason of the Crookedness of the River at that Place, several Trees lay
                        cross both Branches, which stop’d the Passage of each Branch, so that we
                        could proceed no farther with our Boat; but went up the River side by Land,
                        some 3 or 4 Miles, and found the River wider and wider. So we return’d,
                        leaving it, as far as we could see up a long Reach, running N. E. we judging
                        ourselves near fifty Leagues North from the River’s Mouth. In our Return, we
                        view’d the Land on both Sides the River, and found as good Tracts of dry,
                        well-wooded, pleasant, and delightful Ground, as we have seen any where in
                        the World, with abundance of long thick Grass on it, the Land being very
                        level, with steep Banks on both Sides the River, and in some Places very
                        high, the Woods stor’d every where, with great Numbers of Deer and Turkies,
                        we never going on Shoar, but we saw of each Sort; as also great Store of
                        Partridges, Cranes, and Conies, in several Places; we like-wise heard
                        several Wolves howling in the Woods, and saw where they had torn a Deer in
                        Pieces. Also in the River we saw great Store of Ducks, Teal, Widgeon; and in
                        the Woods, great Flocks of Parrakeeto’s. The Timber that the Woods afford,
                        for the most part, consists of Oaks of four or five Sorts, all differing in
                        Leaves, but each bearing very good Acorns. We measur’d many of The Oaks in
                        Several Places, which we found to be, in Bigness, some Two, some Three, and
                        others almost Four Fathom in Height, before you come to Boughs or Limbs;
                        forty, fifty, sixty Foot, and some more; and those Oaks very common in the
                        upper Parts of both Rivers; also a very tall large Tree of great Bigness,
                        which some call <hi rend="italics"><sic>Cyprus</sic>,</hi> the right Name we know not, growing in Swamps. Likewise
                        Walnut, Birch, Beech, Maple, Ash, Bay, Willow, Alder, and Holly; and in the
                        lowermost Parts innumerable Pines, tall and good for Boards of Masts, <pb n="68" xml:id="p68"/> growing, for the most part, in barren and sandy,
                        but in some Places up the River, in good Ground, being <sic>mixt</sic> amongst Oaks and other Timbers. We saw Mulberry-Trees, Multitudes
                        of Grape-Vines, and some Grapes which we eat of. We found a very large and
                        good Tract of Land, on the N. W. Side of the River, thin of Timber, except
                        here and there a very great Oak, and full of Grass, commonly as high as a
                        Man’s Middle, and in many Places to his Shoulders, where we saw many Deer,
                        and Turkies; one Deer having very large Horns, and great Body, therefore
                        call’d it <hi rend="italics">Stag-Park.</hi> It being a very pleasant and
                        delightful Place, we travell’d in it several Miles, but saw no End thereof.
                        So we return’d to our Boat, and proceeded down the River, and came to
                        another Place, some twenty five Leagues from the River’s Mouth on the same
                        Side, where we found a Place, no less delightful than the former; and as far
                        as we could judge, both Tracts came into one. This lower Place we call’d <hi rend="italics">Rocky Point,</hi> because we found many Rocks and Stones,
                        of several Sizes, upon the Land, which is not common. We sent our Boat down
                        the River before us; ourselves travelling by Land, many Miles. Indeed we
                        were so much taken with the Pleasantness of the Country, that we travell’d
                        into the Woods too far to recover our Boat and Company that Night. The next
                        day being <hi rend="italics">Sunday,</hi> we got to our Boat; and on <hi rend="italics">Monday</hi> the 16th of <hi rend="italics">November,</hi>
                        proceeded down to a Place on the East-Side of the River, some 23 Leagues
                        from the Harbour’s Mouth, which we call’d <hi rend="italics"><sic>Turky-Quarters</sic>,</hi> because we kill’d several Turkies thereabouts; we view’d
                        the Land there, and found some Tracts of good Ground, and high, facing upon
                        the River about one Mile inward, but backwards some two Miles, all Pine
                        Land, but good Pasture Ground: We return’d to our Boat, and proceeded down
                        some 2 or 3 Leagues, where we had formerly view’d, and found it a Tract of
                        as good Land, as any we have seen, and had as good Timber on it. The Banks
                        on the River being high, therefore we call’d it <hi rend="italics">High-Land-Point.</hi> Having view’d that, we proceeded down the River,
                        going on Shoar in several Places on both Sides, it being generally large
                        Marshes, and many of them dry, that they may more fitly be <sic>calld</sic> Meadows. The Wood-Land against them is, for the most part, Pine,
                        and in some Places as barren, as ever we saw Land, but in other Places <pb n="69" xml:id="p69"/> good Pasture-Ground. On <hi rend="italics">Tuesday, November</hi> the 17th, we got aboard our Ship, riding against
                        the Mouth of <hi rend="italics">Green’s</hi> River, where our Men were
                        providing Wood, and fitting the Ship for the Sea: In the interim, we took a
                        View of the Country on both sides of the River there, finding some good
                        Land, but more bad, and the best not comparable to that above. <hi rend="italics">Friday</hi> the 20th was foul Weather; yet in the
                        Afternoon we weigh’d, went down the River about two Leagues, and came to an
                        Anchor against the Mouth of <hi rend="italics">Hilton’s</hi> River, and took
                        a View of the Land there on both sides, which appear’d to us much like that
                        at <hi rend="italics">Green’s</hi> River. <hi rend="italics">Monday</hi> the
                        23d, we went, with our Long-Boat well victuall’d and mann’d, up <hi rend="italics">Hilton’s</hi> River; and when we came three Leagues, or
                        thereabouts, up the same, we found this and <hi rend="italics">Green’s</hi>
                        River to come into one, and so continu’d for four or five Leagues, which
                        makes a great Island betwixt them. We proceeded still up the River, till
                        they parted again, keeping up <hi rend="italics">Hilton’s</hi> River on the
                        Larboard side, and follow’d the said River five or six Leagues farther,
                        where we found another large Branch of <hi rend="italics">Green’s</hi> River
                        to come into <hi rend="italics">Hilton’s,</hi> which makes another great
                        Island. On the Starboard side going up, we proceeded still up the River some
                        four Leagues, and return’d, taking a View of the Land on both sides, and
                        then judg’d ourselves to be from our Ship some 18 Leagues W. and by N. One
                        League below this Place, came four <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> in a
                        Canoe to us, and fold us several Baskets of <sic>Acorns,which</sic> we satisfy’d them <sic>for,and</sic> so left them; but one of them follow’d us on the Shoar some two or
                        three Miles, till he came on the Top of a high Bank, facing on the River;
                        and as we row’d underneath it, the Fellow shot an Arrow at us, which very
                        narrowly miss’d one of our Men, and stuck in the upper edge of the Boat; but
                        broke in pieces, leaving the Head behind. Hereupon, we presently made to the
                        Shoar, and went all up the Bank (except Four to guide the Boat) to look for
                        the <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> but could not find him: At last, we
                        heard some sing, farther in the Woods, which we look’d upon as a Challenge
                        to us, to come and fight them. We went towards them with all Speed; but
                        before we came in Sight of them, heard two Guns go off from our Boat;
                        whereupon we retreated, as fast as we could, to secure our Boat and Men.
                        When we <pb n="70" xml:id="p70"/> came to them, we found all well, and
                        demanded the Reason of their firing the Guns: They told us, that an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> came creeping along the Bank, as they
                        suppos’d, to shoot at them; and therefore they shot at him at a great
                        distance, with small Shot, but thought they did him no Hurt; for they saw
                        him run away. Presently after our Return to the Boat, and while we were thus
                        talking, came two <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> to us, with their Bows and
                        Arrows, crying <hi rend="italics">Bonny, Bonny.</hi> We took their Bows and
                        Arrows from them, and gave them Beads, to their Content; then we led them,
                        by the Hand, to the Boat, and shew’d them the Arrow-head sticking in her
                        Side, and related to them the whole Passage; which when they understood,
                        both of them shew’d a great Concern, and signify’d to us, by Signs, that
                        they knew nothing of it; so we let them go, and mark’d a Tree on the Top of
                        the Bank, calling the Place <hi rend="italics">Mount-Skerry.</hi> We look’d
                        up the River, as far as we could discern, and saw that it widen’d, and came
                        running directly down the Country: So we return’d, viewing the Land on both
                        sides the River, and finding the Banks steep in some places, but very high
                        in others. The Bank-sides are generally Clay, and as some of our Company did
                        affirm, some Marl. The Land and Timber up this River is no way <sic>inferiour</sic> to the best in the other, which we call the main River. So far as
                        we could discern, this seem’d as fair, if not fairer, than the former, and
                        we think runs farther into the Country, because a strong Current comes down,
                        and a great deal more Drift-Wood. But, to return to the Business of the Land
                        and Timber: We saw several Plots of Ground clear’d by the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> after their weak manner, compass’d round with great
                        Timber Trees, which they are no-wise able to fell, and so keep the Sun from
                        Corn-Fields very much; yet nevertheless, we saw as large Corn-stalks, or
                        larger, than we have seen any where else: So we proceeded down the River,
                        till we found the Canoe the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> was in, who shot
                        at us. In the Morning, we went on Shoar, and cut the same in pieces. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> perceiving us coming towards them, ran away.
                        Going to his <sic>Hutt</sic>, we pull’d it down, broke his Pots, Platters, and Spoons, tore the
                        Deer-Skins and <sic>Matts</sic> in pieces, and took away a Basket of Acorns; and afterwards
                        proceeded down the River 2 Leagues, <pb n="71" xml:id="p71"/> or
                        thereabouts, and came to another Place of <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>,
                        bought Acorns and some Corn of them, and went downwards 2 Leagues more. At
                        last, espying an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> peeping over a high Bank, we
                        held up a Gun at him; and calling to him, <hi rend="italics">Skerry,</hi>
                        presently several <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> came in Sight of us, and
                        made great Signs of Friendship, saying <hi rend="italics">Bonny, Bonny.</hi>
                        Then running before us, they endeavour’d to persuade us to come on shoar;
                        but we answer’d them with stern Countenances, and call’d out, <hi rend="italics">Skerry,</hi> taking up our Guns, and <sic>threatning</sic> to shoot at them, but they still cry’d <hi rend="italics">Bonny,
                            Bonny:</hi> And when they saw they could not prevail, nor persuade us to
                        come on shoar, two of them came off to us in a Canoe, one paddling with a
                        great Cane, the other with his Hand. As soon as they overtook us, they laid
                        hold of our Boat, sweating and <sic>blowing,and</sic> told us, it was <hi rend="italics">Bonny</hi> on shoar, and at
                        last persuaded us to go on shoar with them. As soon as we landed, several
                            <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> to the Number of near 40 lusty Men,
                        came to us, all in a great Sweat, and told us <hi rend="italics">Bonny:</hi>
                        We shew’d ’em the Arrow-Head in the <sic>Boat-Side,and</sic> a Piece of the Canoe we had cut in Pieces: Whereupon, the chief
                        Man amongst them made a long Speech, threw Beads into our Boat, which is a
                        Sign of great Love and Friendship, and gave us to understand, that when he
                        heard of the Affront which we had receiv’d, it caus’d him to cry; and that
                        he and his Men were come to make Peace with us, assuring us, by Signs, that
                        they would <corr>tye</corr> the Arms, and cut off the Head, of the Fellow
                        who had done us that Wrong; And for a farther Testimony of their Love and
                        Good-Will towards us, they presented us with two very handsome, proper,
                        young <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Women, the tallest that ever we saw in
                        this Country; which we suppos’d to be the King’s Daughters, or Persons of
                        Distinction amongst them. Those young Women were so ready to come into our
                        Boat; that one of them crowded in, and would hardly be persuaded to go out
                        again. We presented the King with a Hatchet and several Beads, and made
                        Presents of Beads also to the young Women, the chief Men, and the rest of
                        the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as far as our Beads would go. They
                        promis’d us, in four Days, to come on board our Ship, and so departed from
                        us. When we left the Place, which was soon after, we call’d it <hi rend="italics">Mount-Bonny,</hi> because we had there concluded a firm
                        Peace. Proceeding down the River 2 or 3 Leagues farther, we came to a Place
                        where were 9 or 10 Canoes <pb n="72" xml:id="p72"/> all together. We went
                        ashoar there, and found several <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> but most of
                        them were the same which had made Peace with us before. We staid very little
                        at that Place, but went directly down the River, and came to our Ship,
                        before day. <hi rend="italics">Thursday</hi> the 26th of <hi rend="italics">November,</hi> the Wind being at South, we could not go down to the
                        River’s Mouth; but on <hi rend="italics">Friday</hi> the 27th, we weigh’d at
                        the Mouth of <hi rend="italics">Hilton’s</hi> River, and got down a League
                        towards the Harbour’s Mouth. On <hi rend="italics">Sunday</hi> the 29th, we
                        got down to <hi rend="italics">Crane-Island,</hi> which is 4 Leagues or
                        thereabouts, above the Entrance of the Harbour’s Mouth. On <hi rend="italics">Tuesday</hi> the Ist of <hi rend="italics">December,</hi>
                        we made a Purchase of the River and Land of <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair,</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Wat-Coosa,</hi> and such other
                            <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as appear’d to us to be the chief of
                        those Parts. They brought us Store of fresh Fish aboard, as Mullets, Shads,
                        and other sorts very good. This River is all fresh Water, fit to drink. Some
                        8 Leagues within the Mouth, the Tide runs up about 35 Leagues, but stops and
                        rises a great deal farther up. It flows at the Harbour’s Mouth, S. E. and N.
                        W. 6 Foot at Neap-Tides, and 8 Foot at Spring-Tides. The Channel on the East
                        side, by the <hi rend="italics">Cape</hi>-Shoar, is the best, and lies close
                        aboard the <hi rend="italics">Cape</hi>-Land, being 3 Fathoms at high Water,
                        in the shallowest Place in the Channel, just at the Entrance; But as soon as
                        you are past that Place, half a Cables Length inward, you have 6 or 7
                        Fathoms, a fair turning Channel into the River, and so continuing 5 or 6
                        Leagues upwards. Afterwards the Channel is more difficult, in some Places 6
                        or 7 Fathoms, in others 4 or 5, and in others but 9 or 10 Foot, especially
                        where the River is broad. When the River comes to part, and grows narrow,
                        there it is all Channel from side to side, in most Places; tho’ in some you
                        shall have 5, 6, or 7 Fathoms, but generally 2 or 3, Sand and Oaze. We
                        view’d the <hi rend="italics">Cape</hi>-Land, and judg’d it to be little
                        worth, the Woods of it being shrubby and low, and the Land sandy and barren;
                        in some Places Grass and Rushes, in others nothing but clear Sand: A Place
                        fitter to starve Cattle, in our Judgment, than to <sic>keep’em</sic> alive; yet the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as we understand,
                        keep the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Cattle down there, and suffer them
                        not to go off of the said <hi rend="italics">Cape,</hi> (as we suppose)
                        because the Country <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> shall have no Part with
                        them; and <sic>therefore’tis</sic> likely, they have fallen out about them, which shall have the
                        greatest Share. They brought on board our <pb n="73" xml:id="p73"/> Ship
                        very good and fat Beef several times, which they sold us at a very
                        reasonable Price; also fat and very large Swine, good and cheap; but they
                        may thank their Friends of <hi rend="italics">New-England,</hi> who brought
                        their Hogs to so fair a Market. Some of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                        brought very good Salt aboard us, and made Signs, pointing to both sides of
                        the River’s Mouth, that there was great Store thereabouts. We saw up the
                        River, several good Places for the setting up of Corn of Saw-Mills. In that
                        time, as our Business call’d us up and down the River and Branches, we
                        kill’d of wild Fowl, 4 Swans, 10 Geese, 29 Cranes, 10 Turkies, 40 Ducks and
                        Mallards, 3 dozen of Parrakeeto’s, and 6 dozen of other small Fowls, as

                    barren of Pine, but affording Pitch, Tar; and Masts; there vastly rich,

                    Places, yielding abundance of Herbage for Cattle, Sheep, and Horse. The Country
                    in general affords pleasant Seats, the Land (except in some few Places) being
                    dry and high Banks, parcell’d out into most convenient Necks, (by the Creeks)
                    easy to be fenced in for securing their Stocks to more strict Boundaries, <pb n="80" xml:id="p80"/> whereby, with a small trouble of fencing, almost every
                    Man may enjoy, to himself, an entire Plantation, or rather Park. These, with the
                    other Benefits of Plenty of Fish, Wild-Fowl, Venison, and the other <sic>Conveniencies</sic> which this Summer-Country naturally furnishes, has induc’d a great
                    many Families to leave the more Northerly <sic>Platations</sic>, and sit down under one of the mildest Governments in the World; in a
                    Country that, with moderate Industry, will afford all the Necessaries of Life.
                    We have yearly abundance of Strangers come among us, who chiefly strive to go
                    Southerly to settle, because there is a vast Tract of rich Land betwixt the

                    River, and more Southerly, which is inhabited by none but a few <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> who are at this time well affected to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and very desirous of their coming to live among
                    them. The more Southerly, the milder Winters, with the Advantages of purchasing
                    the Lords Land at the most easy and moderate Rate of any Lands in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> nay (allowing all Advantages thereto annex’d) I
                    may say, the Universe does not afford such another; Besides, Men have a great
                    Advantage of choosing good and commodious Tracts of Land at the first Seating of
                    a Country or River, whereas the later Settlers are forced to purchase smaller
                    Dividends of the old Standers, and sometimes at very considerable Rates; as now
                    in <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland,</hi> where
                    a thousand Acres of good Land cannot be bought under twenty Shillings an Acre,
                    besides two Shillings yearly Acknowledgment for every hundred Acres; which Sum,
                    be it more or less, will serve to put the Merchant or Planter here into a good
                    posture of Buildings, Slaves, and other Necessaries, when the Purchase of his
                    Land comes to him on such easy Terms. And as our Grain and Pulse thrives with us

                    great likelihood appears of making Salt-peter, because the Earth, in many
                    places, is strongly mix’d with a nitrous Salt, which is much covered by the
                    Beasts, who come at some Seasons in great Droves and Herds, and by their much
                    licking of this Earth, make great Holes in those Banks, which sometimes lie at
                    the heads of great Precipices, where their Eagerness after this Salt hastens
                    their End, by falling down the high Banks, so that they are dash’d in Pieces. It
                    must be confess’d, that the most noble and sweetest Part of this Country, is not
                    inhabited by any but the Savages; and a great deal of the richest Part thereof,
                    has no Inhabitants but the Beasts of the Wilderness: For, the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are not inclinable to settle in the richest Land, because the
                    Timbers are too large for them to cut down, and too much burthen’d with Wood for
                    their Labourers to make Plantations of; besides, the Healthfulness of those
                    Hills is apparent, by the Gigantick Stature, and Gray-Heads, so common amongst
                    the Savages that dwell near the Mountains. The great Creator of all things,

                    pleasant small murmuring Streams, and several beneficial Productions and

                    are a straight, clean-limb’d People; the Children being seldom or never troubled
                    with Rickets, or those other Distempers, that the <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi> are visited withal. ’Tis next to a Miracle, to see one of
                    them deform’d in Body. The Vicinity of the Sun makes Impression on the Men, who
                    labour out of doors, or use the Water. As for those Women, that do not expose
                    themselves to the Weather, they are often very fair, and generally as well <sic>featurd</sic>, as you will see any where, and have very brisk charming Eyes, which
                    sets them off to Advantage. They marry very young; some at Thirteen or Fourteen;
                    and She that stays till Twenty, is reckon’d a stale Maid; which is a very
                    indifferent Character in that warm Country. The Women are very fruitful; most
                    Houses being full of Little Ones. It has been observ’d, that Women long marry’d,
                    and without Children, in other Places, have remov’d to <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and become joyful Mothers. They have very easy Travail in
                    their Child-bearing, in which they are so happy, as seldom to miscarry. Both
                    Sexes are generally spare of Body, and not <sic>Cholerick</sic>, nor easily cast down at Disappointments and Losses, seldom
                    immoderately grieving at Misfortunes, unless for the Loss of their nearest
                    Relations and Friends, which seems to make a more than ordinary Impression upon
                    them. Many of the Women are very handy in Canoes, and will manage them with
                    great Dexterity and Skill, which they become accustomed to in this <sic>watry</sic> Country. They are ready to help their Husbands in any servile Work, as
                    Planting, when the Season of the Weather requires Expedition; Pride seldom
                    banishing good <sic>Houswifery</sic>. The Girls are not bred up to the Wheel, and Sewing only; but the
                    Dairy and Affairs of the House they are very well acquainted withal; so that you
                    shall see them, whilst very young, manage their Business with a great deal of
                    Conduct and Alacrity. The Children of both Sexes are very docile, and learn any
                    thing with <pb n="85" xml:id="p85"/> a great deal of Ease and Method; and those
                    that have the Advantages of Education, write good Hands, and prove good
                    Accountants, which is most coveted, and indeed most necessary in these Parts.
                    The young Men are commonly of a bashful, sober Behaviour; few proving Prodigals,
                    to consume what the Industry of their Parents has left them, but commonly
                    improve it. The marrying so young, carries a double Advantage with it, and that
                    is, that the Parents see their Children provided for in Marriage, and the young
                    married People are taught by their Parents, how to get their Living; for their
                    Admonitions make great Impressions on their Children. I had heard (before I knew
                    this new World) that the Natives of <hi rend="italics">America</hi> were a
                    snort-liv’d People, which, by all the Observations I could ever make, proves
                    quite contrary; for those who are born here, and in other Colonies, live to as
                    great Ages as any of the <hi rend="italics">Europeans,</hi> the Climate being
                    free from Consumptions, which Distemper, fatal to <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> they are Strangers to. And as the Country becomes more
                    clear’d of Wood, it still becomes more healthful to the Inhabitants, and less
                    addicted to the Ague; which is incident to most new Comers into <hi rend="italics">America</hi> from <hi rend="italics">Europe,</hi> yet not
                    moctal. A gentle <sic>Emetick</sic> seldom misses of driving it away, but if it is not too troublesome,
                    ’tis better to let the Seasoning have its own Course, in which case, the Party
                    is commonly free from it ever after, and very healthful.</p>

                <p n="15">And now, as to the other Advantages the Country affords, we cannot guess at them
                    at present, because, as I said before, the best Part of this Country is not
                    inhabited by the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> from whence probably will here
                    after spring Productions that this Age does not dream of, and of much more
                    Advantage to the Inhabitants than any things we are yet acquainted withal: And
                    as for several Productions of other Countries, much in the same Latitude, we may
                    expect, with good Management, they will become familiar to us, as Wine, Oil,
                    Fruit, Silk, and other profitable Commodities, such as Drugs, Dyes, &amp;<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> And at present the Curious may have a large Field to
                    satisfy and divert themselves in, as Collections of strange Beasts, Birds,
                    Infects, Reptiles, Shells, Fishes, Minerals, Herbs, Flowers, Plants, Shrubs,
                    intricate Roots, Gums, Tears, <sic>Rozins</sic>, Dyes, and Stones, with several other that yield Satisfaction and
                    Profit to those, whose Inclinations <pb n="86" xml:id="p86"/> tend that Way. And
                    as for what may be hop’d for, towards a happy Life and Being, by such as design
                    to remove thither, I shall add this; That with prudent Management, I can affirm,
                    by Experience, not by Hear-say, That any Person, with a small Beginning, may
                    live very comfortably, and not only provide for the Necessaries of Life, but
                    likewise for those that are to succeed him; Provisions being very plentiful, and
                    of good Variety, to accommodate genteel House-keeping; <sic>andthe</sic> neighbouring <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are friendly, and in many
                    Cases serviceable to us, in making us Wares to catch Fish in, for a small
                    matter, which proves of great Advantage to large Families, because those Engines
                    take great Quantities of many Sorts of Fish, that are very good and nourishing:
                    Some of them hunt and fowl for us at reasonable Rates, the Country being as
                    plentifully provided with all Sorts of Game, as any Part of <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> the poorer Sort of Planters often get them to plant for them,
                    by hiring them for that Season, or for so much Work, which commonly comes very
                    reasonable. Moreover, it is remarkable, That no Place on the Continent of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> has seated an <hi rend="italics">English</hi>
                    Colony so free from Blood-shed, as <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> but all the
                    others have been more damag’d and disturb’d by the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> than they have; which is worthy Notice, when we consider how
                    oddly it was first planted with Inhabitants.</p>

                <p n="16">The Fishing-Trade in <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> might be carried on to
                    great Advantage, considering how many Sorts of excellent Fish our Sound and
                    Rivers afford, which cure very well with Salt, as has been experienced by some
                    small Quantities, which have been sent abroad, and yielded a good Price. As for
                    the Whale-fishing, it is no otherwise regarded than by a few People who live on
                    the Sand-Banks; and those only work on dead Fish cast on shoar, none being
                    struck on our Coast, as they are to the Northward; altho' we have Plenty of
                    Whales there. Great Plenty is generally the Ruin of Industry. Thus our Merchants
                    are not many, nor have those few there be, apply’d themselves to the <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Trade. The Planter sits contented at home,
                    whilst his Oxen thrive and grow fat, and his Stocks daily increase; The fatted
                    Porkets and Poultry are easily rais’d to his Table, and his Orchard affords him
                    Liquor, so that he eats, and drinks away the Cares of the World, and desires no
                    greater Happiness, than that which <pb n="87" xml:id="p87"/> he daily enjoys.
                    Whereas, not only the <hi rend="italics">European,</hi> but also the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>-Trade, might be carried on to a great Profit,
                    because we lie as fairly for the Body of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> as any
                    Settlement in <hi rend="italics">English-America;</hi> And for the small Trade
                    that has been carried on in that Way, the Dealers therein have throve as fast as
                    any Men, and the soonest rais’d themselves of any People I have known in <hi rend="italics">Carolina.</hi></p>

                <p n="17">Lastly, As to the Climate, it is very healthful; our Summer is not so hot as in
                    other places to the Eastward in the same Latitude; neither are we ever visited
                    by Earthquakes, as many places in <hi rend="italics">Italy</hi> and other
                    Summer-Countries are. Our Northerly Winds, in Summer, cool the Air, and free us
                    from pestilential Fevers, which <hi rend="italics">Spain, Barbary,</hi> and the
                    neighbouring Countries in <hi rend="italics">Europe, &amp;c.</hi> are visited
                    withal. Our Sky is generally serene and clear, and the Air very thin, in
                    comparison of many Parts of <hi rend="italics">Europe,</hi> where Consumptions
                    and Catarrhs reign amongst the Inhabitants. The Winter has several <sic>Fitts</sic> of sharp Weather, especially when the Wind is at N. W. which always
                    clears the Sky, though never so thick before. However, such Weather is very
                    agreeable to <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Bodies, and makes them healthy.
                    The N. E. Winds blowing in Winter, bring with them thick Weather, and, in the
                    Spring, sometimes, blight the Fruits; but they very seldom endure long, being
                    blown away by Westerly Winds, and then all becomes fair and clear again. Our
                    Spring, in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> is very beautiful, and the most
                    pleasant Weather a Country can enjoy. The Fall is accompanied with cool
                    Mornings, which come in towards the latter end of <hi rend="italics">August,</hi> and so continue (most commonly) very moderate Weather till
                    about <hi rend="italics">Christmas;</hi> then Winter comes on apace. Tho’ these
                    Seasons are very piercing, yet the Cold is of no continuance. Perhaps, you will
                    have cold Weather for three or four days at a time; then pleasant warm Weather
                    follows, such as you have in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> about the latter
                    end of <hi rend="italics">April</hi> or beginning of <hi rend="italics">May.</hi> In the Year 1707. we had the severest Winter in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> that ever was known since the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> came to settle there; for our Rivers, that were
                    not above half a Mile wide, and fresh Water, were frozen over; and some of them,
                    in the North-part of this Country, were passable for People to walk over.</p>

                    from its being near <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> where we come often to a

                    to go under their Convoy, and to fell our Provisions to the Tobacco-fleets; for

                <p n="1">THE spontaneous Shrubs of this Country, are, the Lark-heel-Tree; three sorts of <sic>Hony-Suckle-Tree</sic>, the first of which grows in Branches, as our <sic>Piemento-Tree</sic> does, that is, always in low, moist Ground; the other grows in clear,
                    dry Land, the Flower more cut and lacerated; the third, which is the most
                    beautiful, and, I think, the most charming Flower of its Colour, I ever saw,
                    grows betwixt two and three Foot high, and-for the most part, by the side of a
                    swampy Wood, or on the Banks of our Rivers, but never near the Salt-Water. All
                    the Sorts are white; the last grows in a great Bunch of these small <sic>Hony-Suckles</sic> set up-on one chief Stem, and is commonly the Bigness of a large
                    Turnep. Nothing can appear more beautiful than these Bushes, when in their
                    Splendour, which is in <hi rend="italics">April</hi> and <hi rend="italics">May.</hi> The next is the Honey-Suckle of the Forest; it grows about a Foot
                    high, bearing its Flowers on small Pedestals, several of them standing on the
                    main Stock, which is the Thickness of a Wheat-Straw. We have also the Wood-bind,
                    much the same as in <hi rend="italics">England;</hi> Princes-feather, very large
                    and beautiful in the Garden; <hi rend="italics">Tres-Colores,</hi> branch’d
                    Sun-flower, Double Poppies, Lupines, of several pretty sorts, spontaneous; and
                    the <hi rend="italics">Sensible</hi> Plant is said to be near the Mountains,
                    which I have not yet seen. Saf-Flower; (and I believe, the Saffron of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> would thrive here, if planted) the yellow <sic>Jessamin</sic> is wild in our Woods, of a pleasant Smell. Ever-Greens are here
                    plentifully found, of a very quick Growth, and pleasant Shade; Cypress, or white
                    Cedar, the Pitch Pine, the yellow Pine, the white Pine with long Leaves; and the
                    smaller Almond-Pine, which last bears Kernels in the Apple, tasting much like an
                    Almond; and in some years there falls such plenty, as to make the Hogs fat.
                    Horn-Beam; Cedar, two sorts; Holly, two sorts; Bay-Tree, two sorts; one the
                    Dwarf-Bay, about twelve Foot high; the other the Bigness of a middling
                    Pine-Tree, about two Foot and half Diameter; Laurel-Trees, in Height equalizing
                    the lofty Oaks; the Berries and Leaves of this Tree dyes a Yellow; the
                    Bay-Berries yield a Wax, which besides its Use in Chirurgery, makes Candles
                    that, in burning, <pb n="90" xml:id="p90"/> give a fragrant Smell. The
                    Cedar-Berries are infused, and made Beer of, by the <hi rend="italics">Bermudians,</hi> they are Carminative, and much of the Quality of
                    Juniper-Berries; Yew and Box I never saw or heard of in this Country: There are
                    two sorts of Myrtles, different in Leaf and Berry; the Berry yields Wax that
                    makes Candles, the most lasting, and of the sweetest Smell imaginable. Some mix
                    half Tallow with this Wax, others use it without Mixture; and these are sit for
                    a Lady’s Chamber, and incomparable to pass the Line withal, and other hot
                    Countries, because they will stand, when others will melt, by the excessive
                    Heat, down in the <sic>Binacles</sic>. Ever-green Oak, two sorts; Gall-Berry-Tree, bearing a black Berry,
                    with which the Women dye their Cloaths and Yarn black; ’tis a pretty Ever-green,
                    and very plentiful, growing always in low swampy Grounds, and amongst Ponds. We
                    have a Prim or Privet, which grows on the dry, barren, sandy Hills, by the Sound
                    side; it bears a smaller sort than that in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and
                    grows into a round Bush, very beautiful. Last of Bushes, (except Savine, which
                    grows every where wild) is the famous <hi rend="italics">Yaupon,</hi> of which I
                    find two sorts, if not three. I shall speak first of the Nature of this Plant,
                    and afterwards account for the different Sorts. This <hi rend="italics">Yaupon,</hi> call’d by the South-<hi rend="italics">Carolina Indians,
                        Caffena,</hi> is a Bush, that grows chiefly on the Sand-Banks and Islands,
                    bordering on the Sea of <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> on this Coast it is
                    plentifully found, and in no other Place that I know of. It grows the most like
                    Box, of any Vegetable that I know, being very like it in Leaf, only dented
                    exactly like Tea, but the Leaf somewhat fatter. I cannot say, whether it bears
                    any Flower, but a Berry it does, about the Bigness of a Grain of Pepper, being
                    first red, then brown when ripe, which is in <hi rend="italics">December;</hi>
                    Some of these Bushes grow to be twelve Foot high, others are three or four. The
                    Wood thereof is brittle as Myrtle, and affords a light ash-colour’d Bark. There
                    is sometimes found of it in Swamps and rich low Grounds, which has the same
                    figured Leaf, only it is larger, and of a deeper Green; This may be occasion’d
                    by the Richness that attends the low Grounds thus situated. The third Sort has
                    the same kind of Leaf, but never grows a Foot high, and is found both in rich,
                    low Land, and on the Sand-Hills. I don’t know that ever I found any Seed, or
                    Berries on the <pb n="91" xml:id="p91"/> dwarfish Sort, yet I find no Difference
                    in Taste, when Infusion is made: Cattle and Sheep delight in this Plant very
                    much, and so do the Deer, all which crop it very short, and <sic>browze</sic> thereon, wheresoever they meet with it. I have transplanted the
                    Sand-Bank and dwarfish <hi rend="italics">Yaupon,</hi> and find that the first
                    Year, the Shrubs stood at a stand; but the second Year they throve as well as in
                    their native Soil. This Plant is the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Tea, us’d
                    and approv’d by all the Savages on the Coast of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and from them sent to the Westward <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and sold at a considerable Price. All which they cure after
                    the same way, as they do for themselves; which is thus: They take this Plant
                    (not only the Leaves, but the smaller Twigs along with them) and bruise it in a
                    Mortar, till it becomes blackish, the Leaf being wholly defaced: Then they take
                    it out, put it into one of their earthen Pots which is over the Fire, till it
                    smoaks; stirring it all the time, till it is cur’d. Others take it, after it is
                    bruis’d, and put it into a Bowl, to which they put live Coals, and cover them
                    with the <hi rend="italics">Yaupon,</hi> till they have done smoaking, often
                    turning them over. After all, they spread it upon their Mats, and dry it in the
                    Sun. to keep for Use. The <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> in <hi rend="italics">New-Spain</hi> have this Plant very plentifully on the Coast
                    of <hi rend="italics">Florida,</hi> and hold it in great Esteem. Sometimes they
                    cure it as the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> do; or else beat it to a Powder,
                    so mix it, as Coffee; yet before they drink it, they filter the same. They
                    prefer it above all Liquids, to drink with Physick, to carry the same safely and
                    speedily thro’ the Passages, for which it is admirable, as I myself have
                    experimented.</p>

                    first in the Woods; its white Blossom making the Forest very beautiful. It has a
                    fine Grain, and serves for several Uses within doors; but is not durable. The

                    to a large Vine, and twists itself round the Trees it grows near, making a very
                    fine Shade. I never saw any thing of that Nature outdo it, and if it be cut away
                    close to the Ground, it will presently spring up again, it being impossible to

                    because the Leaves, during the Winter-Season, turn red, not recovering their
                    Verdure till the Spring. These Trees are the largest for Height and Thickness,
                    that we have in this Part of the World; some of them holding thirty-six Foot in
                    Circumference. Upon Incision, they yield a sweet-smelling Grain, tho’ not in
                    great Quantities; and the Nuts which these Trees bear plentifully, yield a most
                    odoriferous Balsam, that infallibly cures all new and green Wounds, which the
                    Inhabitants are well acquainted withal. Of these great Trees the Pereaugers and
                    Canoes are scoop’d and made; which sort of Vessels are chiefly <pb n="97" xml:id="p97"/> to pass over the Rivers, Creeks, and Bays; and to transport
                    Goods and Lumber from one River to another. Some are so large, as to carry
                    thirty Barrels, tho’ of one entire Piece of Timber. Others, that are split down
                    the Bottom, and a piece added thereto, will carry eighty, or an hundred. Several

                    laden with Pork, and other Produce of the Country. Of these Trees curious Boats
                    for Pleasure may be made, and other necessary Craft. Some Years ago, a foolish

                    deck’d. She held, as I take it, sixteen Barrels. He brought her to the

                    took him for a Man that had lost his Senses, and argu’d the Danger and
                    Impossibility of performing such a Voyage, in a hollow Tree; but the Fellow
                    would hearken to no Advice of that kind, till the Gentleman told him, if he did
                    not value his own Life, he valu’d his Reputation and Honesty, and so flatly
                    refus’d clearing him; Upon which, the Canoe was sold and, I think, remains in
                    being still. This Wood is very lasting, and free from the Rot. A Canoe of it
                    will outlast four Boats, and seldom wants Repair. They say, that a Chest made of

                    found three sorts. The first is that which we call the common white Hiccory. It
                    is not a durable Wood; for if cut down, and exposed to the Weather, it will be
                    quite rotten, and spoil’d in three Years; as will likewise the Beech of this
                    Country. Hiccory Nuts have very hard Shells, but excellent sweet Kernels, with
                    which, in a plentiful Year, the old Hogs, that can crack them, fatten
                    themselves, and make excellent Pork. These Nuts are gotten, in great Quantities,
                    by the Savages, and laid up for Stores, of which they make several Dishes and
                    Banquets. One of these I cannot forbear mentioning; it is this: They take these
                    Nuts, and break them very small betwixt two Stones, till the Shells and Kernels
                    are indifferent small; And this Powder you are presented withal in their Cabins,
                    in little wooden Dishes; the Kernel dissolves in your Mouth, and the Shell is
                    spit out. This tastes as well as any Almond. Another Dish is the Soup which they
                    make of these Nuts, beaten, and put into Venison-Broth, which dissolves the Nut,
                    and thickens, whilst the Shell precipitates, and remains at the bottom. This
                    Broth tastes <pb n="99" xml:id="p99"/> very rich. There is another sort, which
                    we call red Hiccory, the Heart thereof being very red, firm and durable; of
                    which Walking-Sticks, Mortars, <sic>Pestils</sic>, and several other sine Turnery-wares are made. The third is call’d
                    the Flying-bark’d Hiccory, from its brittle and scaly Bark. It bears a Nut with
                    a bitter Kernel and a soft Shell, like a <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Walnut.

                    suppose, that Name was, at first, to distinguish it from the <sic>Hiccories</sic>, it having a blacker Bark. This Tree grows, in good Land, to a
                    prodigious Bigness. The Wood is very firm and durable, of which Tables and
                    Chests of Drawers are made, and prove very well. Some of this is very knotty,
                    which would make the best Returns for <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> tho’ the
                    Masters of Vessels refuse it, not understanding its Goodness. ’Tis a very good
                    and durable Wood, to bottom Vessels for the Sea withal; and they say, that it is
                    never eaten by the Worm. The Nuts have a large Kernel, which is very oily,
                    except lain by, a long time, to mellow. The Shell is very thick, as all the
                    native Nuts of <hi rend="italics">America</hi> are. When it has its yellow
                    outward Coat on, it looks and smells much like a Lemon.</p>

                <p n="59">Among the natural Fruits, the Vine first takes place, of which I find six sorts,
                    very well known. The first is the black <hi rend="italics">Bunch-Grapes,</hi>
                    which yield a Crimson Juice. These grow common, and bear plentifully. They are
                    of a good Relish, though not large, yet well knit in the Clusters. They have a
                    thickish Skin, and large Stone, which makes them not yield much Juice. There is
                    another sort of Black-Grapes like the former, in all respects, save that their
                    Juice is of a light Flesh-Colour, inclining to a White. I once saw a Spontaneous
                    white Bunch-Grape in <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> but the Cattle <sic>browzing</sic> on the Sprouts thereof in the Spring, it died. Of those which we call
                        <hi rend="italics">Fox-Grapes,</hi> we have four sorts; two whereof are
                    called Summer-Grapes, because ripe in <hi rend="italics">July;</hi> the other
                    two Winter-Fruit, because not ripe till <hi rend="italics">September</hi> or <hi rend="italics">October.</hi> The Summer Fox-Grapes grow not in Clusters, or
                    great Bunches, but are about five or six in a Bunch, about the Bigness of a
                    Damson, or larger. The black sort are frequent, the white not so commonly found.
                    They always grow in Swamps, and low moist Lands, running sometimes very high,
                    and being shady, and therefore proper for Arbours. They afford the largest Leaf
                    I ever saw, to my remembrance, the Back of which is of a white Horse-flesh
                    Colour. This Fruit always ripens in the Shade. I have transplanted them into my
                    Orchard, and find they thrive well, if manured: A <sic>Neighbour</sic> of mine has done the same; mine were by Slips, his from the Roots,
                    which thrive to Admiration, and bear Fruit, tho’ not so juicy as the <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Grape, but of a glutinous Nature. However, it
                    is pleasant enough to eat.</p>
                <p n="60">The other Winter Fox-Grapes, are much of the same Bigness. These refuse no
                    Ground, swampy or dry, but grow plentifully on the Sand-Hills along the
                    Sea-Coast, and elsewhere, and are great Bearers. I have seen near twelve Bushels
                    upon one Vine of the black sort. Some of these, when thoroughly ripe, have a
                    very pretty vinous Taste, and eat very well, yet are glutinous. The white sort
                    are clear and transparent, and indifferent small Stones. Being removed by the
                    Slip or Root, they thrive well in our Gardens, and make pleasant Shades.</p>

                    Astringent I ever met withal, therefore very useful in some Cases. The Fruit, if

                    when ripe, and commonly contains four flat Kernels, call’d Stones, which is the

                <p n="62">We have three sorts of Mulberries, besides the different Bigness of some Trees
                    Fruit. The first is the common red Mulberry, whose Fruit is the earliest we
                    have, (except the Strawberries) and very sweet. These Trees make a very fine
                    Shade, to sit under in Summer-time. They are found wild in great Quantities,
                    wherever the Land is light and rich; yet their Fruit is much better when they
                    stand open. They are used instead of Raisins and Currants, and make several
                    pretty Kickshaws. They yield a transparent Crimson Liquor, which would make good
                    Wine; but few Peoples Inclinations in this Country tend that way. The others are
                    a smooth-leav’d Mulberry, fit for the Silk-Worm. One bears a white Fruit, which
                    is common; the other bears a small black Berry, very sweet. They would persuade
                    me there, that the black Mulberry with the Silk-Worm smooth Leaf, was a white
                    Mulberry, and changed its Fruit. The Wood hereof is very durable, and where the
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> cannot get Locust, they make use of this to
                    make their Bows. This Tree grows extraordinary round and pleasant to the

                    Enquiry must discover. The first sort is the same Blue or Bilberry, that grows
                    plentifully in the <hi rend="italics">North</hi> of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and in other Places, commonly on your Heaths, Commons, and

                <p n="68">The second sort grows on a small Bush in our <hi rend="italics">Savannas</hi> and
                    Meads, and in the Woods. They are larger than the common Fruit, and have larger
                    Seed.</p>
                <p n="69">The third grows on the single Stem of a Stick that grows in low good Land, and on
                    the Banks of Rivers. They grow three or four Foot high, and are very pleasant
                    like the first fort, but larger.</p>
                <p n="70">The fourth sort grows upon Trees, some ten and twelve Foot high, and the
                    Thickness of a Man’s Arm; these are found in the Runs and low Grounds, and are
                    very pleasant, and bear wonderfully. The <hi rend="italics">English</hi>
                    sometimes dry them in the Sun, and keep them to use in the Winter, instead of
                    Currants. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> get many Bushels, and dry them on
                    Mats, whereof they make Plum-Bread, and many other Eatables. They are good in

                    require it. We have a great many sorts of this Fruit, which all thrive to
                    Admiration, Peach-Trees coming to Perfection (with us) as easily as the Weeds. A
                    Peach falling on the Ground, brings a Peach-Tree that shall bear in three years,
                    or sometimes sooner. Eating Peaches in our Orchards makes them come up so thick
                    from the Kernel, that we are forced to take a great deal of Care to weed them
                    out; otherwise they make our Land a Wilderness of Peach-Trees. <pb n="110" xml:id="p110"/> They generally bear so full, that they break great part of
                    their Limbs down. We have likewise very fair Nectarines, especially the red,
                    that clings to the Stone, the other yellow Fruit, that leaves the Stone; of the
                    last, I have a Tree, that, most Years, brings me fifteen or twenty Bushels. I
                    see no Foreign Fruit like this, for thriving in all sorts of Land, and bearing
                    its Fruit to Admiration. I want to be satisfy’d about one sort of this Fruit,
                    which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> claim as their own, and affirm, they
                    had it growing amongst them, before any <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi> came
                    to <hi rend="italics">America.</hi> The Fruit I will describe, as exactly as I
                    can. The Tree grows very large, most commonly as big as a handsome Apple-tree;
                    the Flowers are of a reddish, murrey Colour; the Fruit is rather more downy,
                    than the yellow Peach, and commonly very large and soft, being very full of
                    Juice. They part freely from the Stone, and the Stone is much thicker than all
                    the other Peach Stones we have, which seems to me, that it is a Spontaneous
                    Fruit of <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> yet in those Parts of <hi rend="italics">America</hi> that we inhabit, I never could hear that any
                    Peach-Trees were ever found growing in the Woods; neither have the foreign <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that live remote from the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> any other sort. And those living amongst us have a hundred of
                    this sort for one other; they are a hardy Fruit, and are seldom damaged by the
                    North-East Blasts, as others are. Of this sort we make Vinegar; wherefore we
                    call them Vinegar-Peaches, and sometimes <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>-Peaches.</p>

                    and are so interwoven with one another, that ’tis impossible to pass through
                    them. Moreover, in these Freshes, towards the Hills, the Vines are above five
                    times bigger than those generally with us, who are seated in the Front-parts of
                    this Country, adjoining to the Salts. Of the wild Vines, which are most of them
                    great Bearers, some Wine has been made, which I drank of. It was very strong and
                    well <sic>relisht</sic>; but what detains them all from offering at great quantities, they
                    add, that this Grape has a large Stone, and a thick Skin, and consequently
                    yields but a small Quantity of Wine. Some Essays of this Nature have been made
                    by that Honourable Knight, Sir <hi rend="italics">Nathanael Johnson,</hi> in <hi rend="italics">South Carolina,</hi> who, as I am inform’d, has rejected all
                    Exotick Vines, and makes his Wine from the natural black Grape of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> by grafting it upon its own Stock. What
                    Improvement this may arrive to, I cannot tell; but in other Species, I own
                    Grafting and Imbudding yields speedy Fruit, tho’ I never found that it made them
                    better.</p>
                <p n="118">New planted Colonies are generally attended with a Force and Necessity of
                    Planting the known and approved Staple and Product of the Country, as well as
                    all the Provisions their Families spend. Therefore we can entertain but small
                    hopes of the Improvement of the Vine, till some skilful in dressing Vines shall
                    appear amongst us, and go about it, with a Resolution, that Ordering the
                    Vineyard shall be one half of their Employment. If this be begun and carried on,
                    with that Assiduity and Resolution which it <pb n="113" xml:id="p113"/>
                    requires, then we may reasonably hope to see this a Wine-Country; for then, when
                    it becomes a general Undertaking, every one will be capable to add something to
                    the common Stock, of that which he has gain’d by his own Experience. This way
                    would soon make the Burden light, and a great many short and exacter
                    Curiosities, and real Truths would be found out in a short time. The trimming of
                    Vines, as they do in <hi rend="italics">France,</hi> that is, to a Stump, must
                    either here be not follow’d, or we are not sensible of the exact time, when they
                    ought to be thus pruned; for Experience has taught us, that the <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Grape, suffer’d to run and expand itself at
                    large, has been found to bear as well in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> as it
                    does in <hi rend="italics">Europe;</hi> when, at the same time, the same sort of
                    Vine trimm’d to a Stump, as before spoken of, has born a poor Crop for one Year
                    or two; and by its spilling, after cutting, emaciated, and in three or four
                    Years, died. This Experiment, I believe, has never fail’d; for I have trimm’d
                    the natural Vine the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> way, which has been
                    attended, at last, with the same Fate. Wherefore, it seems most expedient, to
                    leave the Vines more Branches here, than in <hi rend="italics">Europe,</hi> or
                    let them run up Trees, as some do, in <hi rend="italics">Lombardy,</hi> upon
                    Elms. The Mulberries and <hi rend="italics">Chinkapin</hi> are tough, and
                    trimm’d to what you please, therefore fit Supporters of the Vines. Gelding and
                    plucking away the Leaves, to hasten the ripening of this Fruit, may not be
                    unnecessary, yet we see the natural wild Grape generally ripens in the Shade.
                    Nature in this, and many others, may prove a sure Guide. The Twisting of the
                    Stems to make the Grapes ripe together, loses no Juice, and may be beneficial,
                    if done in Season. A very ingenious <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Gentleman,
                    and another from <hi rend="italics">Switzerland,</hi> with whom I frequently
                    converse, exclaim against that strict cutting of Vines, the generally approved
                    Method of <hi rend="italics">France</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Germany,</hi>
                    and say, that they were both out in their Judgment, till of late, Experience has
                    taught them otherwise. Moreover, the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> in <hi rend="italics">North Carolina</hi> assure me, that if we should trim our
                    Apple and other Fruit-Trees, as they do in <hi rend="italics">Europe,</hi> we
                    should spoil them. As for Apples and Plums, I have found by Experience, what
                    they affirm to be true. The <hi rend="italics">French,</hi> from the <hi rend="italics">Mannakin</hi> Town on the Freshes of <hi rend="italics">James</hi> River in <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi>
                    <pb n="114" xml:id="p114"/> had, for the most part, removed themselves to <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> to live there, before I came away; and the
                    rest were following, as their Minister, (Monsieur <hi rend="italics">Philip de
                        Rixbourg</hi>) told me, who was at <hi rend="italics">Bath</hi>-Town, when I
                    was taking my leave of my Friends. He assur’d me, that their Intent was to
                    propagate Vines, as far as their present Circumstances would permit; provided
                    they could get any Slips of Vines, that would do. At the same time, I had gotten
                    some Grape-Seed, which was of the <hi rend="italics">Jesuits</hi> white Grape
                    from <hi rend="italics"><sic>Madera</sic>.</hi> The Seed came up very plentifully, and, I hope, will not
                    degenerate, which if it happens not to do, the Seed may prove the best way to
                    raise a Vineyard, as certainly it is most easy for Transportation. Yet I reckon
                    we should have our Seed from a Country, where the Grape arrives to the utmost
                    Perfection of Ripeness. These <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Refugees have had
                    small Encouragement in <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> because, at their first
                    coming over, they took their Measures of Living, from <hi rend="italics">Europe;</hi> which was all wrong; for the small Quantities of ten, fifteen,
                    and twenty Acres to a Family did not hold out according to their way of
                    Reckoning, by Reason they made very little or no Fodder; and the Winter there
                    being much harder than with us, their Cattle fail’d; chiefly, because the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> took up and survey’d all the Land round about
                    them; so that they were hemm’d in on all Hands from providing more Land for
                    themselves or their Children, all which is highly prejudicial in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> where the generality are bred up to Planting.
                    One of these <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Men being a Fowling, shot a Fowl in
                    the River, upon which his Dog went down the Bank to bring it to his Master; but
                    the Bank was so high and steep, that he could not get up again. Thereupon, the
                        <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Man went down, to help his Dog up, and
                    breaking the Mould away, accidentally, with his Feet, he discover’d a very rich
                    Coal-Mine. This Adventure he gave an Account of amongst the Neighbourhood, and
                    presently one of the Gentlemen of that Part survey’d the Land, and the poor <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Man got nothing by his Discovery. The <hi rend="italics">French</hi> are good Neighbours amongst us, and give Examples
                    of Industry, which is much wanted in this Country. They make good Flax, Hemp, <sic>Linnen-Cloth</sic> and Thread; which they exchange amongst the Neighbourhood for other
                    Commodities, for which they have occasion.</p>

                        <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Inhabitants, his chief Haunt being in the
                    Land of <hi rend="italics"><sic>Messiasippi</sic>,</hi> which is, for the most part, a plain Country; yet I have
                    known some kill’d on the Hilly Part of <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair</hi>-River,
                    they passing the Ledges of vast Mountains from the said <hi rend="italics"><sic>Messiasippie</sic>,</hi> before they can come near us. I have eaten of their Meat,
                    but do not think it so good as our Beef; yet the younger Calves are cry’d up for
                    excellent Food, as very likely they may be. It is conjectured, that these
                    Buffelos, <sic>mixt</sic> in Breed with our tame Cattle, would much better the Breed for
                    Largeness and Milk, which seems very probable. Of the wild Bull’s Skin, Buff is
                    made. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> cut the Skins into Quarters for the
                    Ease <pb n="116" xml:id="p116"/> of their Transportation, and make Beds to lie
                    on. They spin the Hair into Garters, Girdles, Sashes, and the like, it being
                    long and curled, and often of chesnut or red Colour. These Monsters are found to
                    weigh (as I am informed by a Traveller of Credit) from 1600 to 2400 Weight.</p>

It stands betwixt Beef and Pork, and the
                    young Cubs are a Dish for the greatest <hi rend="italics">Epicure</hi> living. I
                    prefer their Flesh before any Beef, Veal, Pork, or Mutton; and they look as well
                    as they eat, their fat being as white as Snow, and the sweetest of any
                    Creature’s in the World. If a Man drink a Quart thereof melted, it never will
                    rise in his Stomach. We prefer it above all things, to fry Fish and other things
                    in. Those that are Strangers to it, may judge otherwise; But I who have eaten a
                    great deal of Bears Flesh in my Life-time (since my being an Inhabitant in <hi rend="italics">America</hi>) do think it equalizes, if not excels, any Meat

                    is nought, all that Season, and eats filthily. Neither is it good, when he feeds
                    on Gum-berries, as I intimated before. They are great Devourers of Acorns, and
                    oftentimes meet the Swine in the Woods, which they kill and eat, especially when
                    they are hungry, and can find no other Food. Now and then they get into the
                    Fields of <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn, or <hi rend="italics">Maiz,</hi>
                    where they make a sad <sic>Havock</sic>, spoiling ten times as much as they eat. The <sic>Potatos</sic> of this Country are so agreeable to them, that they never fail to
                    sweep ’em all clean, if they chance to come in their way. They are seemingly a

                    every Limb thereof. When they come down, they run Tail foremost. At catching of
                    Herrings, they are most expert Fishers. They sit by the Creek-sides, (which are
                    very narrow) where the Fish run in; and there they take them up, as fast as it’s
                    possible they can dip their Paws into the Water. There is one thing more to be
                    consider’d of <pb n="117" xml:id="p117"/> this Creature, which is, that no Man,
                    either Christian or <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> has ever kill’d a She-bear
                    with Young.</p>
                <p n="123">It is supposed, that the She-Bears, after Conception, hide themselves in some
                    secret and undiscoverable Place, till they bring forth their Young, which, in
                    all Probability, cannot be long; otherwise, the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi>
                    who hunt the Woods like Dogs, would, at some time or other, have found them out.
                    Bear-Hunting is a great Sport in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> both with the
                        <hi rend="italics">English</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> Some
                    Years ago, there were kill’d five hundred Bears, in two Counties of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> in one Winter; and but two She-Bears amongst
                    them all, which were not with Young, as I told you of the rest. The <hi rend="italics">English</hi> have a breed of Dogs fit for this sport, about
                    the size of Farmers Curs, and, by Practice, come to know the Scent of a Bear,
                    which as soon as they have found, they run him, by the Nose, till they come up
                    with him, and then bark and snap at him, till he trees, when the Huntsman shoots
                    him out of the Trees, there being, for the most part, two or three with Guns,
                    left the first should miss, or not quite kill him. Though they are not naturally
                    voracious, yet they are very fierce when wounded. The Dogs often bring him to a
                    Bay, when wounded, and then the Huntsmen make other Shots, perhaps with the
                    Pistols that are stuck in their Girdles. If a Dog is apt to fasten, and run into
                    a Bear, he is not good, for the best Dog in <hi rend="italics">Europe</hi> is
                    nothing in their Paws; but if ever they get him in their Clutches, they blow his
                    Skin from his Flesh, like a Bladder, and often kill him; or if he recovers it,
                    he is never good for any thing after. As the Paws of this Creature, are held for
                    the best bit about him, so is the Head esteem’d the worst, and always thrown
                    away, for what reason I know-not. I believe, none ever made Trial thereof, to
                    know how it eats. The Oil of the Bear is very Sovereign for Strains, Aches, and
                    old Pains. The fine Fur at the bottom of the Belly, is used for making Hats, in
                    some places. The Fur itself is fit for several Uses; as for making Muffs, facing
                    Caps, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> but the black Cub-skin is preferable to
                    all sorts of that kind, for Muffs. Its Grain is like Hog-Skin.</p>

                    and thence leaping directly upon them. Thus he takes Deer (which he cannot catch

                    fill their Belly full of Mud; if afterwards they chance to get any thing of

                    Liquor that is sweet and strong. They are rather more unlucky than a Monkey.
                    When wild, they are very subtle in catching their Prey. Those that live in the
                    Salt-Water, feed much on Oysters which they love. They watch the Oyster when it
                    opens, and nimbly put in their Paw, and pluck out the Fish. Sometimes the Oyster
                    shuts, and holds fast their Paw till the Tide comes in, that they are drown’d,
                    tho’ they swim very well. The way that this Animal catches Crabs, which he
                    greatly admires, and which are plenty in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> is
                    worthy of Remark. When he intends to make a Prey of these Fish, he goes to a
                    Marsh, where standing on the Land, he lets his Tail hang in the Water. This the
                    Crab takes for a Bait, and fastens his Claws therein, which as soon as the <hi rend="italics">Raccoon</hi> perceives, he, of a sudden, springs forward, a
                    considerable way, on the Land, and brings the Crab along with him. As soon as
                    the Fish finds himself out of his Element, he presently lets go his hold; and
                    then the <hi rend="italics">Raccoon</hi> encounters him, by getting him
                    cross-wise in his Mouth, and devours him. There is a sort of small Land-Crab,
                    which we call a <hi rend="italics">Fiddler,</hi> that runs into a Hole when any
                    thing pursues him. This Crab the <hi rend="italics">Raccoon</hi> takes by
                    putting his Fore-Foot in the Hole, and pulling him out. With a tame <hi rend="italics">Raccoon,</hi> this Sport is very diverting. The Chief of his
                    other Food is all sorts of wild Fruits, green Corn, and such as the Bear
                    delights in. This and the <hi rend="italics">Possum</hi> are much of a Bigness.

                    chiefly in the Marshes, by the Sea-side and Salt-Waters, where he lives on Fish,
                    Fowl, Mice, and Infects. They are bold Thieves, and will steal any thing <pb n="122" xml:id="p122"/> from you in the Night, when asleep, as I can tell by
                    Experience; for one Winter, by Misfortune, I ran my Vessel a-ground, and went
                    often to the Banks, to kill wild Fowl, which we did a great many. One Night, we
                    had a mind to sleep on the Banks (the Weather being fair) and <sic>wrapt</sic> up the Geese which we had kill’d, and not eaten, very carefully, in
                    the Sail of a Canoe, and folded it several Doubles, and for their better
                    Security, laid ’em all Night under my Head. In the Morning when I wak’d, a Minx
                    had eaten thro’ every Fold of the Canoe’s Sail, and thro’ one of the Geese, most
                    part of which was gone. These are likewise found high up in the Rivers, in whose
                    sides they live; which is known by the abundance of Fresh-Water Muscle-Shells
                    (such as you have in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>) that lie at the Mouth of
                    their Holes. This is an Enemy to the Tortois, whose Holes in the Sand, where

                    up and eats. The <hi rend="italics">Raccoons</hi> and Crows do the same. The <hi rend="italics">Minx</hi> may be made Domestick, and were it not for his
                    paying a Visit now and then to the Poultry, they are the greatest Destroyers of

                    valuable, provided they are kill’d in Season.</p>

                <p n="153">The Allegator is the same, as the Crocodile, and differs only in Name. They
                    frequent the sides of Rivers, in the Banks of which they make their Dwellings a
                    great way under Ground; the Hole or Mouth of their Dens lying commonly two Foot
                    under Water, after which it rises till it be considerably above the Surface
                    thereof. Here it is, that this amphibious Monster dwells all the Winter,
                    sleeping away his time till the Spring appears, when he comes from his Cave, and
                    daily swims up and down the Streams. He always breeds in some fresh Stream, of
                    clear Fountain of Water, yet seeks his Prey in the broad Salt Waters, that are
                    brackish, not on the Sea-side, where I never met with any. He never devours Men
                    in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> but uses all ways to avoid them, yet he
                    kills Swine and Dogs, the former as they come to seed in the Marshes, the others
                    as they swim over the Creeks and Waters. They are very mischievous to the <pb n="127" xml:id="p127"/> Wares made for taking Fish, into which they come to
                    prey on the Fish that are <sic>caughtin</sic> the Ware, from whence they cannot readily extricate themselves, and so
                    break the Ware in Pieces, being a very strong Creature. This Animal, in these
                    Parts, sometimes exceeds seventeen Foot long. It is impossible to kill them with
                    a Gun, unless you chance to hit them about the Eyes, which is a much softer
                    Place, than the rest of their impenetrable <sic>Armour</sic>. They roar, and make a hideous Noise against bad Weather, and before
                    they come out of their Dens in the Spring. I was pretty much <sic>frightned</sic> with one of these once; which happened thus: I had built a House about
                    half a Mile from an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Town, on the Fork of <hi rend="italics">Neus</hi>-River, where I dwelt by my self, excepting a young
                        <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Fellow, and a Bull-Dog, that I had along with
                    me. I had not then been so long a Sojourner in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi>
                    as to be <sic>throughly</sic> acquainted with this Creature. One of them had got his Nest directly
                    under my House, which stood on pretty high Land, and by a Creek-side, in whose
                    Banks his <sic>Entring-place</sic> was, his Den reaching the Ground directly on which my House stood. I
                    was sitting alone by the Fire-side (about nine a Clock at Night, some time in
                        <hi rend="italics">March</hi>) the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Fellow
                    being gone to the Town, to see his Relations; so that there was no body in the
                    House but my self and my Dog; when, all of a sudden, this ill-favour’d Neighbour
                    of mine, set up such a Roaring, that he made the House shake about my Ears, and
                    so continued, like a Bittern, (but a hundred times louder, if possible) for four
                    or five times. The Dog stared, as if he was <sic>frightned</sic> out of his Senses; nor indeed, could I imagine what it was, having
                    never heard one of them before. Immediately again I had another Lesson; and so a
                    third. Being at that time amongst none but Savages, I began to suspect, they
                    were working some Piece of Conjuration under my House, to get away my Goods; not
                    but that, at another time, I have as little Faith in their, or any others
                    working Miracles, by diabolical Means, as any Person living. At last, my Man
                    came in, to whom when I had told the Story, he laugh’d at me, and presently
                    undeceiv’d me, by telling me what it was that made that Noise. These Allegators
                    lay Eggs, as the Ducks do; only they are longer shap’d, larger, and a thicker
                    Shell, than they have. How long they are in hatching, I cannot <pb n="128" xml:id="p128"/> tell; but, as the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> say, it is
                    most part of the Summer, they always lay by a Spring-Side, they young living in
                    and about the same, as soon as hatch’d. Their Eggs are laid in Nests made in the
                    Marshes, and contain twenty or thirty Eggs. Some of these Creatures afford a
                    great deal of Musk. Their Tail, when cut of, looks very fair and white,
                    seemingly like the best of Veal. Some People have eaten thereof, and say, it is
                    delicate Meat, when they happen not to be musky. Their Flesh is accounted proper
                    for such as are troubled with the lame Distemper, (a sort of <sic>Rhumatism</sic>) so is the Fat very prevailing to remove Aches and Pains, by Unction.
                    The Teeth of this Creature, when dead, are taken out, to make Chargers for Guns,
                    being of several Sizes, fit for all Loads. They are white, and would make pretty
                    Snuff-Boxes, if wrought by an Artist. After the Tail of the Allegator is
                    separated from the Body, it will move very freely for four days.</p>

                    that I ever had any Account of; being so call’d from the Rattle at the end of
                    their Tails, which is a Connexion of jointed Coverings, of an excrementitious
                    Matter, betwixt the Substance of a Nail, and a Horn, though each <hi rend="italics">Tegmen</hi> is very thin. Nature seems to have design’d
                    these, on purpose to give Warning of such an approaching Danger, as the venomous
                    Bite of these Snakes is. Some of them grow to a very great Bigness, as six Foot
                    in Length, their Middle being the Thickness of the Small of a lusty Man’s Leg.
                    We have an Account of much larger Serpents of this Kind; but I never met them
                    yet, although I have seen and kill’d abundance in my time. They are of an
                    Orange, tawny, and blackish Colour, on the Back; differing (as all Snakes do) in
                    Colour, on the Belly; being of an Ash-Colour, inclining to Lead. The Male is
                    easily distinguish’d from the Female, by a black Velvet-Spot on his Head; and
                    besides, his Head is smaller shaped, and long. Their Bite is venomous, if not
                    speedily remedied; especially, if the Wound be in a Vein, Nerve, Tendon, or
                    Sinew; when it is very difficult to cure. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    are the best Physicians for the Bite of these and all other venomous Creatures
                    of this Country. There are four sorts of Snake-Roots already discover’d, which
                    Knowledge came from the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> who have perform’d
                    several great <pb n="129" xml:id="p129"/> Cures. The Rattle-Snakes are accounted
                    the peaceablest in the World; for they never attack any one, or injure them,
                    unless they are trod upon, or molested. The most Danger of being bit by these
                    Snakes, is for those that survey Land in <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> yet I
                    never heard of any Surveyor that was kill’d, or hurt by them. I have myself gone
                    over several of this Sort, and others; yet it pleased God, I never came to any
                    harm. They have the Power, or Art (I know not which to call it) to charm
                    Squirrels, Hares, Partridges, or any such thing, in such a manner, that they run
                    directly into their Mouths. This I have seen by a Squirrel and one of these
                    Rattle-Snakes; and other Snakes have, in some measure, the same Power. The
                    Rattle-Snakes have many small Teeth, of which I cannot see they make any use;
                    for they swallow every thing whole; but the Teeth which poison, are only four;
                    two on each side of their Upper-Jaws. These are bent like a Sickle, and hang
                    loose as if by a Joint. Towards the setting on of these, there is, in each
                    Tooth, a little Hole, wherein you may just get in the Point of a small Needle.
                    And here it is, that the Poison comes out, (which is as green as Grass) and
                    follows the Wound; made by the Point of their Teeth. They are much more venomous
                    in the Months of <hi rend="italics">June</hi> and <hi rend="italics">July,</hi>
                    than they are in <hi rend="italics">March, April</hi> or <hi rend="italics">September.</hi> The hotter the Weather, the more poisonous. Neither may we
                    suppose, that they can renew their Poison as as they will; for we have had a
                    Person bit by one of these, who never rightly recover’d it, and very hardly
                    escaped with Life; a second Person bit in the same Place by the same Snake, and
                    receiv’d no more Harm, that if bitten with a Rat. They cast their Skins every
                    Year, and commonly abide near the Place where the old Skin lies. These call
                    Skins are used in Physick, and the Rattles are reckon’d good to expedite the
                    Birth. The Gall is made up into Pills, with Clay, and kept for Use; being given
                    in Pestilential Fevers and the Small-Pox. It is accounted a noble Remedy, known
                    to few, and held as a great <hi rend="italics">Arcanum.</hi> This Snake has two
                    Nostrils on each side of his Nose. Their Venom, I have Reason to believe,
                    effects no Harm, any otherwise than when darted into the Wound by the Serpents
                    Teeth.</p>

                    any thing approaches them. They strike at their Enemy with their Tail, and kill
                    whatsoever they wound with it, which is arm’d at the End with a horny Substance,
                    like a Cock’s Spur. This is their Weapon. I have heard it credibly reported, by
                    those who said they were Eye-Witnesses, that a small Locust-Tree, about the
                    Thickness of a Man’s Arm, being struck by one of these Snakes, at Ten a Clock in

                    and the Leaves red and wither’d. Doubtless, be it how it will, they are very

                    Trees by the Water-Side. I had the Fortune once to have one of them leap into my

                    the Salts, and lies under the Drift Sea-weed, where they are in abundance, and

                    Mouser that can be; for he leaves not one of that Vermine alive, where he comes.
                    He also kills the Rattle-Snake, wheresoever he meets him, by twisting his Head
                    about the Neck of the Rattle-Snake, and whipping him to Death with his Tail.
                    This Whipster haunts the Dairies of careless Housewives, and never misses to
                    skim the Milk clear of the Cream. He is an excellent Egg-Merchant, for he does
                    not suck the Eggs, but swallows them whole (as all Snakes do.) He will often
                    swallow all the Eggs from under a Hen that sits, and coil himself under the Hen,
                    in the Nest, where sometimes the Housewife finds him. This Snake, for all his

                <p n="182">As the Eagle is reckon’d the King of Birds I have begun with him. The first I
                    shall speak of, is the bald Eagle; so call’d, because his Head, to the middle of
                    his Neck, and his Tail, is as white as Snow. These Birds continually breed the
                    Year round; for when the young Eagles are just down’d, with a sort of white
                    woolly Feathers, the Hen-Eagle lays again, which Eggs are hatch’d by the Warmth
                    of the young ones in the Nest, so that the Flight of one Brood makes Room for
                    the next, that are but just hatch’d. They prey on any living thing they can
                    catch. They are heavy of Flight, and cannot get their Food by Swiftness, to help
                    which there is a Fishawk that catches Fishes, and suffers the Eagle to take them
                    from her, although she is long-wing’d and a swift Flyer, and can make far better
                    way in her Flight than the Eagle can. The bald Eagle attends the Gunners in
                    Winter, with all the Obsequiousness imaginable, and when he shoots and kills any
                    Fowl, the Eagle surely comes in for his Bird; and besides, those that are
                    wounded, and escape the Fowler, fall to the Eagle’s share. He is an excellent
                    Artist at stealing young Pigs, which Prey he carries alive to his Nest, at which
                    time the poor Pig makes such a Noise over Head, that Strangers that have heard
                    them cry, and not seen the Bird and his Prey, have thought there were Flying
                    Sows and Pigs in that Country. The Eagle’s Nest is made of Twigs, Sticks and
                    Rubbish. It is big enough to fill a handsome Carts Body, and commonly so full of
                    nasty Bones and Carcasses that it stinks most offensively. This Eagle is not
                    bald, till he is one or two years old.</p>

                    Birds do not breed amongst us, (who are settled at, and near the Mouths of the
                    Rivers, as I have intimated to you before) but come down (especially in hard
                    Winters) amongst the Inhabitants, in great Flocks, as they were seen to do in
                    the Year 1707, which was the hardest Winter that ever was known, since <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> has been seated by the Christians. And is that
                    Country had such hard Weather, what must be expected of the severe Winters in
                        <hi rend="italics">Pennsylvania, New-York,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">New-England,</hi> where Winters are ten times (if possible) colder than
                    with us. Although the Flocks are, in such Extremities, very numerous; yet they
                    are not to be mention’d in Comparison with the great and infinite Numbers of
                    these Fowl, that are met withal about a hundred, or a hundred and fifty, Miles
                    to the Westward of the Places where we at present live; and where these Pigeons
                    come down, in quest of a small sort of Acorns, which in those Parts are
                    plentifully found. They are the same we call <sic>Turky-Acorns</sic>, because the wild Turkies feed very much thereon; And for the same
                    Reason, those Trees that bear them, are call’d <sic>Turky-Oaks</sic>. I saw such prodigious Flocks of these Pigeons, in <hi rend="italics">January</hi> or <hi rend="italics">February,</hi> 1701-2, (which were in
                    the hilly Country, between the great Nation of the <hi rend="italics">Esaw
                        Indians,</hi> and the pleasant Stream of <hi rend="italics">Sapona,</hi>
                    which is the West-Branch of <hi rend="italics">Clarendon,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Cape-Fair</hi> River) that they had broke down the Limbs of a
                    great many large Trees all over those Woods, whereon they chanced to sit and
                    roost; especially the great Pines, which are a more brittle Wood, than our sorts
                    of Oak are. These Pigeons, about Sun-Rise, when we were preparing to march on
                    our Journey, would fly by us in such vast Flocks, that they would be near a
                    Quarter of an Hour, before they were all pass’d by; and as soon as that Flock
                    was gone, another would come; and so successively one after another, for great
                    part of the Morning. It is observable, that whereever these Fowl come in such
                    Numbers, as I saw them then, they clear all before them, scarce leaving one
                    Acorn upon the Ground, which would, doubtless, be a great Prejudice to the
                    Planters that should seat there, because their Swine would be thereby depriv’d
                    of their Mast. When I saw such Flocks of the Pigeons I now speak of, none of our
                    Company had any other sort of Shot, than that which is cast in Moulds, and was
                    so very large, that we could not put above ten or a <pb n="142" xml:id="p142"/>
                    dozen of them into our largest Pieces; Wherefore, we made but an indifferent
                    Hand of shooting them; although we commonly kill’d a Pigeon for every Shot. They
                    were very fat, and as good Pigeons, as ever I eat. I enquired of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> that dwell’d in those Parts, where it was that
                    those Pigeons bred, and they pointed towards the vast Ridge of Mountains, and
                    said, they bred there. Now, whether they make their Nests in the Holes in the
                    Rocks of those Mountains, or build in Trees, I could not learn; but they seem to
                    me to be a Wood-Pigeon, that build in Trees, because of their frequent sitting
                    thereon, and their Roosting on Trees always at Night, under which their Dung
                    commonly lies half a Foot thick, and kills every thing that grows where it
                    falls.</p>

                <p n="293">Whales are very numerous, on the Coast of North <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi>
                    from which they make Oil, Bone, &amp;<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> to the great
                    Advantage of thoé inhabiting the Sand-Banks, along the Ocean, where these Whales
                    come ashore, none being struck or kill’d with a Harpoon in this Place, as they
                    are to the Northward, and elsewhere; all those Fish being found dead on the
                    Shoar, most commonly by those that inhabit the Banks, and Sea-side, where they
                    dwell, for that Intent, and for the Benefit of Wrecks, which sometimes fall in
                    upon that Shoar.</p>
                <p n="294">Of these Monsters there are four sorts; the first, which is most choice and rich,
                    is the <hi rend="italics">Sperma Cæti</hi> Whale, from which the <hi rend="italics">Sperma Cæti</hi> is taken. These are rich Prizes; but I never
                    heard but of one found on this Coast, which was near <hi rend="italics">Currituck</hi>-Inlet.</p>
                <p n="295">The other sorts are of a prodigious Bigness. Of these the Bone and Oil is made;
                    the Oil being the Blubber, or oily Flesh, or Fat of that Fish boil’d. These
                    differ not only in Colour, some being pied, others not, but very much in shape,
                    one being call’d a Bottle-Nosed Whale, the other a Shovel-Nose, which is as
                    different as a Salmon from a Sturgeon. These Fish seldom come ashoar with their
                    Tongues in their Heads, the Thrasher (which is the Whale’s mortal Enemy,
                    wheresoever he meets him) eating that out of his Head, as soon as he and the
                    Sword-Fish have kill’d him. For <pb n="154" xml:id="p154"/> when the
                    Whale-catchers (in other Parts) kill any of these Fish, they eat the Tongue, and
                    esteem it an excellent Dish.</p>
                <p n="296">There is another sort of these Whales, or great Fish, though not common. I never
                    knew of above one of that sort, found on the Coast of North <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and he was contrary, in Shape, to all others ever found
                    before him; being sixty Foot in Length, and not above three or four Foot
                    Diameter. Some <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> in <hi rend="italics">America</hi> will go out to Sea, and get upon a Whales Back, and peg or
                    plug up his Spouts, and so kill him.</p>

                    strong Horns, and is of a monstrous Size, and Strength; for this Fish has been
                    known to weigh a Sloop’s Anchor, and run with the Vessel a League or two, and
                    bring her back, against Tide, to almost the same Place. Doubtless, they may
                    afford good Oil; but I have no Experience of any Profits which arise from

                    turns Tail, and runs away. Their <sic>Livors</sic> make good Oil to dress Leather withal; the Bones found in their Head
                    are said to hasten the Birth, and ease the Stone, by bringing it away. Their
                    Meat is eaten in scarce times; but I never could away with it, though a great
                    Lover of Fish. Their Back-Bone is of one entire Thickness. Of the Bones, or
                    Joints, I have known Buttons made, which serve well enough in scarce Times, and

                    good firm Meat, but the Head is beyond all the Fish I ever met withal for an

                    People go down and catch as many Barrels full as they please, with Hook and
                    Line, especially every young Flood, when they bite. These are salted up, and
                    transported to other Colonies, that are bare of Provisions.</p>

                <p n="377">And thus I have gone through the several Species of Fish, so far as they have
                    come to my Knowledge, in the eight Years that I have lived in <hi rend="italics">Carolina.</hi> I should have made a larger Discovery, when travelling so
                    far towards the Mountains, and amongst the Hills, had it not been in the
                    Winter-Season, which was improper to make any Enquiry into any of the Species
                    before recited. Therefore, as my Intent was, I proceed to what remains of the
                        <hi rend="italics">Present State</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi>
                    having already accounted for the Animals, and Vegetables, as far as this Volume
                    would allow of; whereby the Remainder, though not exactly known, may yet be
                    guess’d at, if we consider what Latitude <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> lies
                    in, which reaches from 29 to 36 deg. 30 min. Northern Latitude, as I have before
                    observ’d. Which Latitude is as fertile and pleasant, as any in the World, as
                    well for the Produce of Minerals, Fruit, Grain, and Wine, as other rich
                    Commodities. And indeed, all the Experiments that have been made in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> of the Fertility and natural Advantages of the
                    Country, have exceeded all Expectation, as affording some Commodities, which
                    other Places, in the same Latitude, do not. As for Minerals, as they are
                    subterraneous Products, so, in all new Countries, they are the Species that are
                    last discover’d; and especially, in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> where the
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> never look for any thing lower than the
                    Superficies of the Earth, being a Race of Men the least addicted to delving of
                    any People that inhabit so fine a Country as <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi>
                    is. As good if not better Mines than those the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi>
                    possess in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> lie full West from us; and I am
                    certain, we have as Mountainous Land, and as great Probability of having rich
                    Minerals in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> as any of those Parts that are
                    already found to be so rich therein. But, waving this subject, till some other
                    Opportunity, I shall now give you some Observations in general, concerning <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> which are, , that it lies as convenient for
                    Trade as any of the Plantations in <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> that we have
                    Plenty of Pitch, Tar, Skins of Deer, and Beeves, Furs, Rice, Wheat, <sic>Rie</sic>, <hi rend="italics">Indian Grain,</hi> sundry sorts of Pulse,
                    Turpentine, <sic>Rozin</sic>, Masts, Yards, Planks and Boards, Staves and Lumber Timber of many
                    common sorts, sit for any Uses; Hemp, Flax, Barley, <pb n="164" xml:id="p164"/>
                    Oats, Buck-Wheat, Beef, Pork, Tallow, Hides, Whale-Bone and Oil, Wax, Cheese,
                    Butter, &amp;<hi rend="italics">c.</hi> besides Drugs, Dyes, Fruit, Silk,
                    Cotton, <sic>Indico</sic>, Oil, and Wine that we need not doubt of, as soon as we make a regular
                    Essay, the Country being adorn’d with pleasant Meadows, Rivers, Mountains,
                    Valleys, Hills, and rich Pastures, and blessed with wholesome pure Air;
                    especially a little backwards from the Sea, where the wild Beasts inhabit, none
                    of which are voracious. The Men are active, the Women fruitful to Admiration,
                    every House being full of Children, and several Women that have come hither
                    barren, having presently prov’d fruitful. There cannot be a richer Soil, no
                    Place abounding more in Flesh and Fowl, both wild and tame, besides Fish, Fruit,
                    Grain, Cider, and many other pleasant Liquors; together with several other
                    Necessaries for Life and Trade, that are daily found out, as new Discoveries are
                    made. The Stone and Gout seldom trouble us; the Consumption we are wholly
                    Strangers to, no Place affording a better Remedy for that Distemper, than <hi rend="italics">Carolina.</hi> For Trade, we lie so near to <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> that we have the Advantage of their Convoys;
                    as also Letters from thence, in two or three Days at most, in some Places in as
                    few Hours. Add to this, that the great Number of Ships which come within those
                    Capes, for <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland,</hi> take off our Provisions, and give us Bills of Exchange for
                        <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> which is Sterling Money. The Planters in
                        <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> are
                    forc’d to do the same, the great Quantities of Tobacco that are planted there,
                    making Provisions scarce; and Tobacco is a Commodity oftentimes so low, as to
                    bring nothing, whereas Provisions and Naval Stores never fail of a Market.
                    Besides, where these are raised, in such Plenty as in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> there always appears good Housekeeping, and Plenty of all
                    manner of delicate Eatables. For Instance, the Pork of <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> is very good, the younger Hogs fed on Peaches, Maiz, and such
                    other natural Produce; being some of the sweetest Meat that the World affords,
                    as is acknowledged by all Strangers that have been there. And as for the Beef,
                    in <hi rend="italics">Pampticough,</hi> and the Southward Parts, it proves
                    extraordinary. We have not only Provisions plentiful, but Cloaths of our own
                    Manufactures, which are made, and daily increase; Cotton, Wool, Hemp, and Flax,
                    being of our own Growth; and the Women <pb n="165" xml:id="p165"/> to be highly
                    commended for their Industry in Spinning, and ordering their <sic>Houswifery</sic> to so great Advantage as they generally do; which is much more easy,
                    by reason this happy Climate, visited with so mild Winters, is much warmer than
                    the Northern Plantations, which saves abundance of Cloaths; fewer serving our
                    Necessities, and those of our Servants. But this is not all; for we can go out
                    with our Commodities, to any other Part of the <hi rend="italics">West-Indies,</hi> or elsewhere, in the Depth of Winter; whereas, those in
                        <hi rend="italics">New-England, New-York, Pennsylvania,</hi> and the
                    Colonies to the Northward of us, cannot stir for Ice, but are fast lock’d into
                    their Harbours. Besides, we can trade with South-<hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and pay no Duties or Customs, no more than their own
                    Vessels, both North and South being under the same <hi rend="italics">Lords-Proprietors.</hi> We have, as I observ’d before, another great
                    Advantage, in not being a Frontier, and so continually alarm’d by the Enemy; and
                    what has been accounted a Detriment to us, proves one of the greatest Advantages
                    any People could wish; which is, our Country’s being faced with a Sound near ten
                    Leagues over in some Places, through which, although their be Water enough for
                    as large Ships to come in at, as in any part hitherto seated in both <hi rend="italics">Carolinas;</hi> yet the Difficulty of that Sound to
                    Strangers, hinders them from attempting any Hostilities against us; and, at the
                    same time, if we consider the Advantages thereof, nothing can appear to be a
                    better Situation, than to be fronted with such a Bulwark, which secures us from
                    our Enemies. Furthermore, our Distance from the Sea rids us of two Curses, which
                    attend most other Parts of <hi rend="italics">America, viz.</hi>
                    <sic>Muskeetos</sic>, and the Worm-biting, which eats Ships Bottoms out; whereas at <hi rend="italics">Bath-Town,</hi> there is no such thing known; and as for <sic>Muskeetos</sic>, they hinder us of as little Rest, as they do you in <hi rend="italics">England.</hi> Add to this, the unaccountable Quantities of
                    Fish this great Water, or Sound, supplies us withal, whenever we take the Pains
                    to fish for them; Advantages I have no where met withal in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> except here. As for the Climate, we enjoy a very <sic>wholsome</sic> and serene Sky, and a pure and thin Air, the Sun seldom missing to
                    give us his daily Blessing, unless now and then on a Winters Day, which is not
                    often; and when cloudy, the first Appearance of a North-West Wind clears the
                    Horizon, and restores the Light of the Sun. The Weather, in Summer, is very
                    pleasant; <pb n="166" xml:id="p166"/> the hotter Months being refresh’d with
                    continual Breezes of cool reviving Air; and the Spring being as pleasant, and
                    beautiful, as in any Place I ever was in. The Winter, most commonly, is so mild,
                    that it looks like an Autumn, being now and then attended with clear and thin
                    North-West Winds, that are sharp enough to regulate <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Constitutions, and free them from a great many dangerous
                    Distempers, that a continual Summer afflicts them withal, nothing being wanting,
                    as to the natural Ornaments and Blessings of a Country, that conduce to make
                    reasonable Men happy. And, for those that are otherwise, they are so much their
                    own Enemies, where they are, that they will scarce ever be any ones Friends, or
                    their own, when they are transplanted; so, it’s much better for all sides, that
                    they remain as they are. Not but that there are several good People, that, upon
                    just Grounds, may be uneasy under their present Burdens; and such I would advise
                    to remove to the Place I have been treating of, where they may enjoy their
                    Liberty and Religion, and peaceably eat the Fruits of their Labour, and drink
                    the Wine of their own Vineyards, without the Alarms of a troublesome worldly
                    Life. If a Man be a <hi rend="italics">Botanist,</hi> here is a plentiful Field
                    of <hi rend="italics">Plants</hi> to divert him in; If he be a <hi rend="italics">Gardner,</hi> and delight in that pleasant and happy Life, he
                    will meet with a Climate and Soil, that will further and promote his Designs, in
                    as great a Measure, as any Man can wish for; and as for the Constitution of this
                    Government, it is so mild and easy, in respect to the Properties and Liberties
                    of a Subject, that without rehearsing the Particulars, I say once for all, it is
                    the mildest and best establish’d Government in the World, and the Place where
                    any Man may peaceably enjoy his own, without being invaded by another; Rank and
                    Superiority ever giving Place to Justice and Equity, which is the Golden Rule
                    that every Government ought to be built upon, and regulated by. Besides, it is
                    worthy our Notice, that this Province has been settled, and continued the
                    most-free from the Insults and Barbarities of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> of any Colony that was ever yet seated in <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> which must be esteem’d as a particular Providence of God
                    handed down from Heaven, to these People; especially, when we consider, how
                    irregularly they settled North-<hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and yet how
                    undisturb’d they have ever remain’d, free from any foreign Danger <pb n="167" xml:id="p167"/> or Loss, even to this very Day. And what may well be look’d
                    upon for as great a Miracle, this is a Place, where no Malefactors are found,
                    deserving Death, or even a Prison for Debtors; there being no more than two
                    Persons, that, as far as I have been able to learn, ever suffer’d as Criminals,
                    although it has been a Settlement near sixty Years; One of whom was a <hi rend="italics">Turk</hi> that committed <hi rend="italics">Murder;</hi> the
                    other, an old Woman, for <hi rend="italics">Witchcraft.</hi> These, tis true,
                    were on the Stage, and acted many Years, before I knew the Place; but as for the
                    last, I wish it had been undone to this day; although they give a great many
                    Arguments, to <sic>justifie</sic> the Deed, which I had rather they should have a Hand in, than myself;
                    seeing I could never approve of taking Life away upon such Accusations, the
                    Justice whereof I could never yet understand.</p>
                <p n="378">But, to return to the Subject in Hand; we there make extraordinary good Bricks
                    throughout the Settlement. All sorts of Handicrafts, as <hi rend="italics">Carpenters, Joiners, Masons, <sic>Plaisterers</sic>, <sic>Shooemakers</sic>, Tanners, Taylors, Weavers,</hi> and most others, may, with small
                    Beginnings, and God’s Blessing, thrive very well in this Place, and provide
                    Estates for their Children, Land being fold at a much cheaper Rate there, than
                    in any other <sic>Placein</sic>
                    <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> and may, as I suppose, be purchased of the <hi rend="italics">Lords-Proprietors</hi> here in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> or of the Governour there for the time being, by any that
                    shall have a mind to transport themselves to that Country. The Farmers that go
                    thither (for which sort of Men it is a very thriving Place) should take with
                    them some particular Seeds of Grass, as Trefoil, Clover-grass all sorts,
                    Sanfoin, and Common Grass, or that which is a Rarity in <hi rend="italics">Europe;</hi> especially, what has sprung and rose first from a warm
                    Climate, and will endure the Sun without flinching. Likewise, if there be any
                    extraordinary sort of Grain for Increase or Hardiness, and some Fruit-Trees of
                    choice Kinds, they will be both profitable and pleasant to have with you, where
                    you may see the Fruits of your Labour in Perfection, in a few Years. The
                    necessary Instruments of Husbandry I need not acquaint the Husbandman withal;
                    Hoes of all sorts, and Axes must be had, with Saws, Wedges, Augurs, Nails,
                    Hammers, and what other Things may be necessary for building with Brick, or
                    Stone, which sort your Inclination and <sic>Conveniency</sic> lead you to. <pb n="168" xml:id="p168"/> For, after having look’d over
                    this Treatise, you must needs be acquainted with the Nature of the Country, and
                    therefore cannot but be Judges, what it is that you will chiefly want. As for
                    Land, none need want it for taking up, even in the Places there seated on the
                    Navigable Creeks, Rivers, and Harbours, without being driven into remoter Holes
                    and Corners of the Country, for Settlements, which all are forced to do, who, at
                    this day, settle in most or all of the other <hi rend="italics">English</hi>
                    Plantations in <hi rend="italics">America;</hi> which are already become so
                    populous, that a New-Comer cannot get a beneficial and commodious Seat, unless
                    he purchases, when, in most Places in <hi rend="italics">Virginia</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Maryland,</hi> a thousand Acres of good Land, seated on a
                    Navigable Water, will cost a thousand Pounds; whereas, with us, it is at present
                    obtain’d for the fiftieth Part of the Money. Besides, our Land pays to the <hi rend="italics">Lords,</hi> but an easy Quit-Rent, or yearly Acknowledgement;
                    and the other Settlements pay two Shillings <hi rend="italics">per</hi> hundred.
                    All these things duly weighed, any rational Man that has a mind to purchase Land
                    in the Plantations for a Settlement of himself and Family, will soon discover
                    the Advantages that attend the Settlers and Purchasers of Land in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> above all other Colonies in the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Dominions in <hi rend="italics">America.</hi>
                    And as there is a free Exercise of all Persuasions amongst Christians, the <hi rend="italics">Lords-Proprietors,</hi> to encourage Ministers of the Church
                    of <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> have given free Land towards the Maintenance
                    of a Church, and especially, for the Parish of S. <hi rend="italics">Thomas</hi>
                    in <hi rend="italics">Pampticough,</hi> over-against the Town, is already laid
                    out for a Glebe of two hundred and twenty three Acres of rich well-situated
                    Land, that a Parsonage-House may be built upon. And now I shall proceed to give
                    an Account of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> their Customs and Ways of
                    Living, with a short Dictionary of their Speech.</p>

                    not wrought in me a full Satisfaction, to allow these People to have been the

                    Marks of a Deluge, (that at some time has probably made strange Alterations, as
                    to the Station that Country was then in) that ever I saw, or, I think, read of,
                    in any History. Amongst the other Subterraneous Matters, that have been
                    discover’d, we found, in digging of a Well that was twenty six foot deep, at the
                    Bottom thereof, many large Pieces of the Tulip-Tree, and several other sorts of
                    Wood, some of which were cut and notch’d, and some squared, as the <sic>Joices</sic> of a House are, which appear’d (in the Judgment of all that saw them)
                    to be wrought with Iron Instruments; <pb n="170" xml:id="p170"/> it seeming
                    impossible for any thing made of Stone, or what they were found to make use of,
                    to cut Wood in that manner. It cannot be argu’d, that the Wood so cut, might
                    float from some other Continent; because Hiccory and the Tulip-Tree are
                    spontaneous in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> and in no other Places, that I
                    could ever learn. It is to be acknowledg’d, that the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> give us Relations of magnificent Buildings, which were
                    raised by the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Mexico</hi>
                    and other Parts, which they discover’d, and conquer’d; amongst whom no Iron
                    Instruments were found: But ’tis a great Misfortune, that no Person in that
                    Expedition was so curious, as to take an exact Draught of the Fabricks of those
                    People, which would have been a Discovery of great Value, and very acceptable to
                    the Ingenious; for, as to the Politeness of Stones, it may be effected by
                    Collision, and Grinding, which is of a contrary Nature, on several Accounts, and
                    disproves not my Arguments, in the least.</p>

                    People enjoy, which is an Eastern Product, and will keep and retain its
                    vegetative and growing Faculty, the longest of any thing of that Nature, that I
                    know of. The Stone, as I elsewhere have remark’d, is thicker than any other sort
                    of the Peaches in <hi rend="italics">Europe,</hi> or of the <hi rend="italics">European</hi> sort, now growing in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> and is
                    observed to grow if planted, after it has been for several Years laid by; and it
                    seems very probable, that these People might come from some Eastern Country; for
                    when you ask them whence their Fore-Fathers came, that first inhabited the
                    Country, they will point to the Westward and say, <hi rend="italics">Where the
                        Sun sleeps our Forefathers came thence,</hi> which, at that distance, may be
                    reckon’d amongst the Eastern Parts of the World. And to this day, they are a
                    shifting, <sic>wandring</sic> People; for I know <pb n="171" xml:id="p171"/> some <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Nations, that have chang’d their Settlements, many hundred
                    Miles; sometimes no less than a thousand, as is prov’d by the <hi rend="italics">Savanna Indians,</hi> who formerly lived on the Banks of the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Messiasippi</sic>,</hi> and remov’d thence to the Head of one of the Rivers of
                        South-<hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> since which, (for some Dislike) most
                    of them are remov’d to live in the Quarters of the <hi rend="italics">Iroquois</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Sinnagars,</hi> which are on the Heads
                    of the Rivers that disgorge themselves into the Bay of <hi rend="italics"><sic>Chesapeak</sic>.</hi> I once met with a young <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    Woman, that had been brought from beyond the Mountains, and was sold a Slave
                    into <hi rend="italics">Virginia.</hi> She spoke the same Language, as the <hi rend="italics">Coranine Indians,</hi> that dwell near Cape-<hi rend="italics">Look-out,</hi> allowing for some few Words, which were
                    different, yet no otherwise, than that they might understand one another very

                <p n="5">The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of North-<hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> are
                    a well-shap’d clean-made People, of different statures, as the <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi> are, yet chiefly inclin’d to be tall. They are
                    a very streight People, and never bend forwards, or stoop in the Shoulders,
                    unless much overpower’d by old Age. Their Limbs are exceeding well-shap’d. As
                    for their Legs and Feet, they are generally the handsomest in the World. Their
                    Bodies are a little flat, which is occasion’d, by being laced hard down to a
                    Board, in their Infancy. This is all the Cradle they have, which I shall
                    describe at large elsewhere. Their Eyes are black, or of a dark <sic>Hazle</sic>; The White is marbled with red Streaks, which is ever common to these
                    People, unless when sprung from a white Father or Mother. Their Colour is of a
                    tawny, which would not be so dark, did they not <sic>dawb</sic> themselves with Bears Oil, and a Colour like burnt Cork. This is begun
                    in their Infancy, and continued for a long time, which fills the Pores, and
                    enables them better to endure the Extremity of the Weather. They are never bald
                    on their Heads, although never so old, which, I believe, proceeds from their
                    Heads being always uncover’d, and the greasing their Hair (so often as they do)
                    with Bears Fat, which is a great Nourisher of the Hair, and causes it to grow
                    very fast. Amongst the Bears Oil (when they intend to be fine) they mix a
                    certain red Powder, that comes from a Scarlet Root which they get in the hilly
                    Country, near the Foot of the great Ridge of Mountains, and it is no where else
                    to be found. They have this Scarlet Root in great Esteem, and sell it for a very
                    great <pb n="172" xml:id="p172"/> Price, one to another. The Reason of its Value
                    is, because they not only go a long way for it, but are in great Danger of the
                        <hi rend="italics">Sinnagars</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Iroquois,</hi> who
                    are mortal Enemies to all our <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and very often
                    take them Captives, or kill them, before they return from this Voyage. The <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruros</hi> and other <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    have often brought this Seed with them from the Mountains; but it would never
                    grow in our Land. With this and Bears Grease they anoint their Heads and
                    Temples, which is esteem’d as ornamental, as sweet Powder to our Hair. Besides,
                    this Root has the Virtue of killing Lice, and suffers none to abide or breed in
                    their Heads. For want of this Root, they sometimes use <hi rend="italics">Pecoon</hi>-Root, which is of a Crimson Colour, but it is apt to die the
                    Hair of an ugly Hue.</p>

                <p n="6">Their Eyes are commonly full and manly, and their Gate sedate and majestick. They
                    never walk backward and forward as we do, nor contemplate on the Affairs of Loss
                    and Gain; the things which daily perplex us. They are dexterous and steady both
                    as to their Hands and Feet, to Admiration. They will walk over deep Brooks, and
                    Creeks, on the smallest Poles, and that without any Fear or Concern. Nay, an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> will Walk on the Ridge of a Barn or House and
                    look down the Gable-end, and spit upon the Ground, as unconcern’d, as if he was
                    walking on <hi rend="italics">Terra firma.</hi> In Running, Leaping, or any such
                    other Exercise, their Legs seldom miscarry, and give them a Fall; and as for
                    letting any thing fall out of their Hands, I never yet knew one Example. They
                    are no <sic>Inventers</sic> of any Arts or Trades worthy mention; the Reason of which I take to
                    be, that they are not possess’d with that Care and Thoughtfulness, how to
                    provide for the Necessaries of Life, as the <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi>
                    are; yet they will learn any thing very soon. I have known an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> stock Guns better than most of our <hi rend="italics">Joiners,</hi> although he never saw one stock’d before; and besides, his
                    Working-Tool was only a sorry Knife. I have also known several of them that were
                    Slaves to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> learn Handicraft-Trades very well
                    and speedily. I never saw a Dwarf amongst them, nor but one that was
                    Hump-back’d. Their Teeth are yellow with Smoaking Tobacco, which both Men and
                    Women are much addicted to. They tell us, that they had Tobacco amongst them,
                    before the <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi> made any Discovery of <pb n="173" xml:id="p173"/> that Continent. It differs in the Leaf from the
                    sweet-scented, and <hi rend="italics">Oroonoko,</hi> which are the Plants we
                    raise and cultivate in <hi rend="italics">America.</hi> Theirs differs likewise
                    much in the Smell, when green, from our Tobacco, before cured. They do not use
                    the same way to cure it as we do; and therefore, the Difference must be very
                    considerable in Taste; for all Men (that know Tobacco) must allow, that it is
                    the Ordering thereof which gives a Hogoo to that Weed, rather than any Natural
                    Relish it possesses, when green. Although they are great Smokers, yet they never
                    are seen to take it in Snuff, or chew it.</p>
                <p n="7">They have no Hairs on their Faces (except some few) and those but little, nor is
                    there often found any Hair under their Arm-Pits. They are continually plucking
                    it away from their Faces, by the Roots. As for their Privities, since they wore
                    Tail-Clouts, to cover their Nakedness, several of the Men have a deal of Hair
                    thereon. It is to be observ’d, that the Head of the <hi rend="italics">Penis</hi> is cover’d (throughout all the Nations of the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> I ever saw) both in Old and Young. Although we reckon these a
                    very smooth People, and free from Hair; yet I once saw a middle-aged Man, that
                    was hairy all down his Back; the Hairs being above an Inch long.</p>

                    Account how his Blindness came. They had a Use for him, which was, to lead him
                    with a Girl, Woman, or Boy, by a String; so they put what Burdens they pleased
                    upon his Back, and made him very serviceable upon all such Occasions. No People

                    made in the middle of the House, which is the largest in the Town, and is very
                    often the Dwelling of their King, or War-Captain; where fit two Men on the

                    and one Stick in his Hand to beat thereon; and so they both begin the Song

                    so that they have remain’d the Winners Servants, till their Relations or
                    themselves could pay the Money to redeem them; and when this happens, the Loser
                    is never dejected or melancholy at the Loss, but laughs, and seems no less

                    Cedar; and sometimes, when they are a great way from any of these Woods, they
                    make use of Pine-Bark, which is the worser sort. In building these Fabricks,
                    they get very long Poles, of Pine, Cedar, Hiccory, or any Wood that will bend;
                    these are the Thickness of the Small of a Man’s Leg, at the thickest end, which
                    they generally strip of the Bark, and warm them well in the Fire, which makes
                    them tough and fit to bend; afterwards, they stick the thickest ends of them in
                    the Ground, about two Yards asunder, in a Circular Form, the distance they
                    design the Cabin to be, (which is not always round, but sometimes oval) then
                    they bend the Tops and bring them together, and bind their ends with Bark of
                    Trees, that is proper for that use, as Elm is, or sometimes the Moss that grows
                    on the Trees, and is a Yard or two long, and never rots; then they brace them
                    with other Poles, to make them strong; afterwards, cover them all over with
                    Bark, so that they are very warm and tight, and will keep firm against all the
                    Weathers that blow. They have other sorts of Cabins without Windows, which are
                    for their Granaries, Skins, and Merchandizes; and others that are cover’d over
                    head; the rest left open for the Air. These have Reed-Hurdles, like Tables, to
                    lie and fit on, in Summer, and serve for pleasant Banqueting-Houses in the hot
                    Season of the Year. The Cabins they dwell in have Benches all round, except
                    where the Door stands; on these they lay Beasts-Skins, and Mats made of Rushes,
                    whereon they sleep and loll. In one of these, several Families commonly live,

                <p n="24">The Victuals is common, throughout the whole Kindred Relations, and often to the
                    whole Town; especially, when they are in Hunting-Quarters, then they all fare
                    alike, whichsoever of them kills the Game. They are very kind, and charitable to
                    one another, but more especially to those of their own Nation; for if any one of
                    them has suffer’d any Loss, by Fire or otherwise, they order the griev’d Person
                    to make a Feast, and invite them all thereto, which, on the day appointed, they
                    come to, and after every Man’s Mess of Victuals is dealt to him, one of their
                    Speakers, or grave old Men, makes an Harangue, and acquaints the Company, That
                    that Man’s House has been burnt, wherein all his Goods were destroy’d; That he,
                    and his Family, very narrowly escaped; That he is every Man’s Friend in that
                    Company; and, That it is all their Duties to help him, as he would do to any of
                    them, had the like Misfortune befallen them. After this Oration is over, every
                    Man, according to his Quality, throws him down upon the Ground some Present,
                    which is commonly Beads, <hi rend="italics">Ronoak, Peak,</hi> Skins or Furs,
                    and which very often amounts to treble the Loss he has suffer’d. <pb n="179" xml:id="p179"/> The same Assistance they give to any Man that wants to build
                    a Cabin, or make a Canoe. They say, it is our Duty thus to do; for there are
                    several Works that one Man cannot effect, therefore we must give him our Help,
                    otherwise our Society will fall, and we shall be depriv’d of those urgent
                    Necessities which Life requires. They have no Fence to part one <sic>anothers</sic> Lots in their Corn-Fields; but every Man knows his own, and it scarce
                    ever happens, that they rob one another of so much as an Ear of Corn, which if
                    any is found to do, he is sentenced by the Elders to work and plant for him that
                    was robb’d, till he is recompensed for all the Damage he has suffer’d in his
                    Corn-Field; and this is punctually perform’d, and the <sic>Thiese</sic> held in Disgrace, that steals from any of his Country-Folks. It often
                    happens, that a Woman is destitute of her Husband, and has a great many Children
                    to maintain; such a Person they always help, and make their young men plant,
                    reap, and do every thing that she is not capable of doing herself; yet they do
                    not allow any one to be idle, but to employ themselves in some Work or
                    other.</p>

                <p n="27">When an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> is dead, the greater Person he was, the
                    more expensive is his Funeral. The first thing which is done, is, to place the
                    nearest Relations near the Corps, who mourn and weep very much, having their
                    Hair hanging down their <pb n="180" xml:id="p180"/> Shoulders, in a very forlorn
                    manner. After the dead Person has lain a Day and a Night, in one of their
                    Hurdles of Canes, commonly in some Out-House made for that purpose, those that
                    officiate about the Funeral, go into the Town, and the first young Men they meet
                    withal, that have Blankets or Match Coats on, whom they think fit for their
                    Turn, they strip them from their Backs, who suffer them so to do, without any
                    Resistance. In these they wrap the dead Bodies, and cover them with two or three
                    Mats, which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> make of Rushes or Cane; and last
                    of all, they have a long Web of woven Reeds, or hollow Canes, which is the
                    Coffin of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and is brought round several
                    times, and tied fast at both ends, which indeed, looks very decent and well.
                    Then the Corps is brought out of the House, into the Orchard of Peach-Trees,
                    where another Hurdle is made to receive it, about which comes all the Relations
                    and Nation that the dead Person belong’d to, besides several from other Nations
                    in Alliance with them; all which sit down on the Ground, upon Mats spread there,
                    for that purpose; where the Doctor or Conjurer appears; and, after some time,
                    makes a Sort of <hi rend="italics">O-yes,</hi> at which all are very silent;
                    then he begins to give an Account, who the dead Person was, and how stout a Man
                    he approv’d himself; how many Enemies and Captives he had kill’d and taken; how
                    strong, tall, and nimble he was; that he was a great Hunter, a Lover of his
                    Country, and possess’d of a great many beautiful Wives and Children, esteem’d
                    the greatest of Blessings among these Savages, in which they have a true Notion.
                    Thus this Orator runs on, highly extolling the dead Man, for his Valour,
                    Conduct, Strength, Riches, and Good-Humour; and enumerating his Guns, Slaves and
                    almost every thing he was possess’d of, when living. After which, he addresses
                    himself to the People of that Town or Nation, and bids them supply the dead
                    Man’s Place, by following his steps, who, he assures them, is gone into the
                    Country of Souls, (which they think lies a great way off, in this World, which
                    the Sun visits, in his ordinary Course) and that he will have the Enjoyment of
                    handsome young Women, great Store of Deer to hunt, never meet with Hunger, Cold
                    or Fatigue, but every thing to answer his Expectation and Desire. This is the
                    Heaven they propose to themselves; but, on the contrary, <figure xml:id="ill5"/>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="p181"/> for those <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> that are
                    lazy, thievish amongst themselves, bad Hunters, and no Warriours, nor of much
                    Use to the Nation, to such they allot, in the next World, Hunger, Cold,
                    Troubles, old ugly Women for their Companions, with Snakes, and all sorts of
                    nasty Victuals to feed on. Thus is mark’d out their Heaven and Hell. After all
                    this Harangue, he diverts the People with some of their Traditions, as when
                    there was a violent hot Summer, or very hard Winter; when any notable Distempers
                    rag’d amongst them; when they were at War with such and such Nations; how
                    victorious they were; and what were the Names of their War-Captains. To prove
                    the times more exactly, he produces the Records of the Country, which are a
                    Parcel of Reeds, of different Lengths, with several distinct Marks, known to
                    none but themselves; by which they seem to guess, very exactly, at Accidents
                    that happen’d many Years ago; nay two or three Ages or more. The Reason I have
                    to believe what they tell me, on this Account, is, because I have been at the
                    Meetings of several <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Nations; and they agreed, in
                    relating the same Circumstances, as to Time, very exactly; as, for Example, they
                    say, there was so hard a Winter in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> 105 years
                    ago, that the great Sound was frozen over, and the Wild Geese came into the
                    Woods to eat Acorns, and that they were so tame, (I suppose, through Want) that
                    they kill’d abundance in the Woods, by knocking them on the Head with
                    Sticks.</p>

                <p n="28">But, to return to the dead Man. When this long Tale is ended, by him that spoke
                    first; perhaps, a second begins another long Story; so a third, and fourth, if
                    there be so many Doctors present; which all tell one and the same thing. At
                    last, the Corps is brought away from that Hurdle to the Grave, by four young
                    Men, attended by the Relations, the King, old Men, and all the Nation. When they
                    come to the Sepulcre, which is about six Foot deep, and eight Foot long, having
                    at each end (that is, at the Head and Foot) a Light-Wood, or Pitch-Pine Fork
                    driven close down the sides of the Grave, firmly into the Ground; (these two
                    Forks are to contain a Ridge-Pole, as you shall understand presently) before
                    they lay the Corps into the Grave, they cover the bottom two or three times over
                    with Bark of Trees, then they let down the Corps (with two Belts, that the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    <pb n="182" xml:id="p182"/> carry their Burdens withal) very leisurely, upon the
                    said Barks; then they lay over a Pole of the same Wood, in the two Forks, and
                    having a great many Pieces of Pitch-Pine Logs, about two Foot and a half long,
                    they stick them in the sides of the Grave down each End, and near the Top
                    thereof, where the other Ends lie on the Ridge-Pole, so that they are declining
                    like the Roof of a House. These being very thick-plac’d, they cover them (many
                    times double) with Bark; then they throw the Earth thereon, that came out of the
                    Grave, and beat it down very firm; by this Means, the dead Body lies in a Vault,
                    nothing touching him; so that when I saw this way of Burial, I was mightily
                    pleas’d with it, esteeming it very decent and pretty, as having seen a great
                    many Christians buried without the tenth Part of that Ceremony and Decency. Now,
                    when the Flesh is rotted and moulder’d from the Bone, they take up the Carcass,
                    and clean the Bones, and joint them together; afterwards, they dress them up in
                    pure white dress’d Deer-Skins, and lay them amongst their Grandees and Kings in
                    the <hi rend="italics">Quiogozon,</hi> which is their Royal Tomb or Burial-Place
                    of their Kings and War-Captains. This is a very large magnificent Cabin,
                    (according to their Building) which is rais’d at the Publick Charge of the
                    Nation, and maintain’d in a great deal of Form and Neatness. About seven foot
                    high, is a Floor or Loft made, on which lie all their Princes, and Great Men,
                    that have died for several hundred Years, all attir’d in the Dress I before told
                    you of. No Person is to have his Bones lie here, and to be thus dress’d, unless
                    he gives a round Sum of their Money to the Rulers, for Admittance. If they
                    remove never so far, to live in a Foreign Country, they never fail to take all
                    those dead Bones along with them, though the Tediousness of their short daily
                    Marches keeps them never so long on their Journey. They reverence and adore this
                        <hi rend="italics">Quiogozon,</hi> with all the Veneration and Respect that
                    is possible for such a People to discharge, and had rather lose all, than have
                    any Violence or Injury offer’d thereto. These Savages differ some small matter
                    in their Burials; some burying right upwards, and otherwise, as you are
                    acquainted withal in my Journal from South to North <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> Yet they all agree in their Mourning, which is, to appear
                    every Night, at the Sepulcre, and howl and weep in a very dismal manner, having
                    their Faces <pb n="183" xml:id="p183"/> dawb’d over with Light-wood Soot, (which
                    is the same as Lamp-black) and Bears Oil. This renders them as black as it is
                    possible to make themselves, so that theirs very much resemble the Faces of
                    Executed Men boil’d in Tar. If the dead Person was a Grandee, to carry on the
                    Funeral Ceremonies, they hire People to cry and lament over the dead Man. Of
                    this sort there are several, that practise it for a Livelihood, and are very
                    expert at Shedding abundance of Tears, and howling like Wolves, and so
                    discharging their Office with abundance of Hypocrisy and Art. The Women are
                    never accompanied with these Ceremonies after Death; and to what World they
                    allot that Sex, I never understood, unless, to wait on their dead Husbands; but
                    they have more Wit, than some of the Eastern Nations, who sacrifice themselves
                    to accompany their Husbands into the next World. It is the dead Man’s Relations,
                    by Blood, as his Uncles, Brothers, Sisters, Cousins, Sons, and Daughters, that
                    mourn in good earnest, the Wives thinking their Duty is discharg’d, and that
                    they are become free, when their Husband is dead; so, as fast as they can, look
                    out for another, to supply his Place.</p>

                <p n="29">As for the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Women, which now happen in my Way; when
                    young, and at Maturity, they are as fine-shap’d Creatures (take them generally)
                    as any in the Universe. They are of a tawny Complexion; their Eyes very brisk
                    and amorous; their Smiles afford the finest Composure a Face can possess; their
                    Hands are of the finest Make, with small long Fingers, and as soft as their
                    Cheeks; and their whole Bodies of a smooth Nature. They are not so uncouth or
                    unlikely, as we suppose them; nor are they Strangers or not Proficients in the
                    soft Passion. They are most of them mercenary, except the married Women, who
                    sometimes bestow their Favours also to some or other, in their Husbands Absence.
                    For which they never ask any Reward. As for the Report, that they are never
                    found unconstant, like the <hi rend="italics">Europeans,</hi> it is wholly
                    false; for were the old World and the new one put into a Pair of Scales (in
                    point of Constancy) it would be a hard Matter to discern which was the heavier.
                    As for the Trading Girls, which are those design’d to get Money by their Natural
                    Parts, these are <sic>discernable</sic>, by the Cut of their Hair; their Tonsure differing from all others, of
                    that Nation, <pb n="184" xml:id="p184"/> who are not of their Profession; which
                    Method is intended to prevent Mistakes; for the Savages of <hi rend="italics">America</hi> are desirous (if possible) to keep their Wives to themselves,
                    as well as those in other Parts of the World. When any Addresses are made to one
                    of these Girls, she immediately acquaints her Parents therewith, and they tell
                    the King of it, (provided he that courts her be a Stranger) his Majesty commonly
                    being the principal Bawd of the Nation he rules over, and there seldom being any
                    of these <hi rend="italics">Winchester</hi>-Weddings agreed on, without his
                    Royal Consent. He likewise advises her what Bargain to make, and if it happens
                    to be an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Trader that wants a Bed-fellow, and has
                    got Rum to sell, be sure, the King must have a large Dram for a Fee, to confirm
                    the Match. These <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that are of the elder sort,
                    when any such Question is put to them, will debate the Matter amongst themselves
                    with all the Sobriety and Seriousness imaginable, every one of the Girl’s
                    Relations arguing the Advantage or Detriment that may ensue such a Night’s
                    Encounter; all which is done with as much Steadiness and Reality, as if it was
                    the greatest Concern in the World, and not so much as one Person shall be seen
                    to smile, so long as the Debate holds, making no Difference betwixt an Agreement
                    of this Nature, and a Bargain of any other. If they comply with the Men’s
                    Desire, then a particular Bed is provided for them, either in a Cabin by
                    themselves, or else all the young people turn out, to another Lodging, that they
                    may not spoil Sport; and if the old People are in the same <sic>Cabia</sic> along with them all Night, they lie as unconcern’d, as if they were so
                    many Logs of Wood. If it be an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> of their own Town
                    or Neighbourhood, that wants a Mistress, he comes to none but the Girl, who
                    receives what she thinks fit to ask him, and so lies all Night with him, without
                    the Consent of her Parents.</p>

                    for when a Person that lives amongst them, is reserv’d from the Conversation of

                <p n="31">But one great Misfortune which oftentimes attends those that converse with these
                    Savage Women, is, that they get Children by them, which are seldom educated any
                    otherwise than in a State of Infidelity; for it is a certain Rule and Custom,
                    amongst all the Savages of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> that I was ever
                    acquainted withal, to let the Children always fall to the Woman’s Lot; for it
                    often happens, that two <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> that have liv’d
                    together, as Man and Wife, in which Time they have had several Children; if they
                    part, and another Man possesses her, all the Children go along with the Mother,
                    and none with the Father. And therefore, on this Score, it ever seems impossible
                    for the Christians to get their Children (which they have by these <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Women) away from them; whereby they might bring
                    them up in the Knowledge of the Christian Principles. Nevertheless, we often
                    find, that <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Men, and other <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi> that have been accustom’d to the Conversation of these
                    savage Women, and their Way of Living, have been so allur’d with that careless
                    sort of Life, as to be constant to their <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Wife,
                    and her Relations, so long as they liv’d, without ever desiring to return again
                    amongst the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> although they had very fair
                    Opportunities of Advantages amongst their Countrymen; of which sort I have known

                <p n="33">When any young <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> has a Mind for such a Girl to his
                    Wife, he, or some one for him, goes to the young Woman’s Parents, if living; if
                    not, to her nearest Relations; where they make Offers of the Match betwixt the
                    Couple. The Relations reply, they will consider of it, which serves for a
                    sufficient Answer, till there be a second Meeting about the Marriage, which is
                    generally brought into Debate before all the Relations (that are old People) on
                    both Sides; and sometimes the King, with all his great Men, give their Opinions
                        <pb n="186" xml:id="p186"/> therein. If it be agreed on, and the young Woman
                    approve thereof, (for these Savages never give their Children in Marriage,
                    without their own Consent) the Man pays so much for his Wife; and the handsomer
                    she is, the greater Price she bears. Now, it often happens, that the Man has not
                    so much of their Money ready, as he is to pay for his Wife; but if they know him
                    to be a good Hunter, and that he can raise the Sum agreed for, in some few
                    Moons, or any little time, they agree, she shall go along with him, as
                    betroth’d, but he is not to have any Knowledge of her, till the utmost Payment
                    is discharg’d; all which is punctually observ’d. Thus, they lie together under
                    one Covering for several Months, and the Woman remains the same as she was when
                    she first came to him. I doubt, our <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi> would be
                    apt to break this Custom, but the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Men are not so
                    vigorous and impatient in their Love as we are. Yet the Women are quite
                    contrary, and those <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Girls that have convers’d
                    with the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> and other <hi rend="italics">Europeans,</hi> never care for the Conversation of their own Countrymen
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p n="34">They never marry so near as a first Cousin; and although there is nothing more
                    coveted amongst them, than to marry a Woman of their own Nation, yet when the
                    Nation consists of a very few People (as nowadays it often happens) so that they
                    are all of them related to one another, then they look out for Husbands and
                    Wives amongst Strangers. For if an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> lies with his
                    Sister, or any very near Relation, his Body is burnt, and his Ashes thrown into
                    the River, as unworthy to remain on Earth; yet an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    is allow’d to marry two Sisters, or his Brother’s Wife. Although these People
                    are call’d Savages, yet Sodomy is never heard of amongst them, and they are so
                    far from the Practice of that beastly and loathsome Sin, that they have no Name
                    for it in all their Language.</p>

                    other, upon any frivolous Excuse they can make; yet whosoever takes the Woman
                    that was another Man’s before, and bought by him, as they all are, must
                    certainly pay to her former Husband, whatsoever he gave for her. Nay, if she be
                    a Widow, and her Husband died in Debt, whosoever takes her to Wife, pays all her
                    Husband’s Obligations, <pb n="187" xml:id="p187"/> though never so many; yet the
                    Woman is not required to pay any thing (unless she is willing) that was owing
                    from her Husband, so long as she keeps Single. But if a Man courts her for a
                    Nights Lodging, and obtains it, the Creditors will make him pay her Husband’s
                    Debts, and he may, if he will, take her for his Money, or sell her to another
                    for his Wife. I have seen several of these Bargains driven in a day; for you may
                    see Men selling their Wives as Men do Horses in a Fair, a Man being allow’d not
                    only to change as often as he pleases, but likewise to have as many Wives as he
                    is able to maintain. I have often seen, that very old <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Men (that have been Grandees in their own Nation) have had
                    three or four very likely young <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Wives, which I
                    have much wondered at, because to me they seem’d incapacitated to make good Use

                    their Children; sometimes they bring Twins, and are brought to bed by
                    themselves, when took at a Disadvantage; not but that they have Midwives amongst
                    them, as well as Doctors, who make it their Profession (for Gain) to assist and
                    deliver Women, and some of these Midwives are very knowing in several Medicines
                    that <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> affords, which certainly expedite, and
                    make easy Births. Besides, they are unacquainted with those severe Pains which
                    follow the Birth in our <hi rend="italics">European</hi> Women. Their Remedies
                        <corr>area</corr> great Cause of this Easiness in that State; for the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Women will run up and down the Plantation, the
                    same day, very briskly, and without any sign of Pain or Sickness; yet they look
                    very meager and thin. Not but that we must allow a great deal owing to the
                    Climate, and the natural Constitution of these Women, whose Course of Nature
                    never visits them in such Quantities, as the <hi rend="italics">European</hi>
                    Women have. And tho’ they never want Plenty of Milk, yet I never saw an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Woman with very large Breasts; neither does the
                    youngest Wife ever fail of proving so good a Nurse, as to bring her Child up
                    free from the Rickets and Disasters that proceed from the Teeth, with many other
                    Distempers which attack our Infants in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> and
                    other Parts of <hi rend="italics">Europe.</hi> They let their Children suck till
                    they are well grown, unless they prove big with Child sooner. They always nurse
                    their own Children themselves, unless Sickness or Death prevents. I once saw a
                    Nurse hired to give Suck to an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Woman’s Child,
                    which you have in my Journal. After Delivery, they absent the Company of a Man
                    for forty days. As soon as the Child is born, they wash it in cold Water at the
                    next Stream, and <pb n="190" xml:id="p190"/> then <sic>bedawb</sic> it, as I have mention’d before. After which, the Husband takes care to
                    provide a Cradle, which is soon made, consisting of a Piece of flat Wood, which
                    they hew with their Hatchets to the Likeness of a Board; it is about two Foot
                    long, and a Foot broad; to this they brace and tie the Child down very close,
                    having, near the middle, a Stick fasten’d about two Inches from the Board, which
                    is for the Child’s Breech to rest on, under which they put a Wad of Moss, that
                    receives the Child’s Excrements, by which means they can shift the Moss, and
                    keep all clean and sweet. Some Nations have very flat Heads, as you have heard
                    in my Journal, which is made whilst tied on this Cradle, as that Relation
                    informs you. These Cradles are apt to make the Body flat; yet they are the most
                    portable things that can be invented; for there is a String which goes from one
                    Corner of the Board to the other, whereby the Mother slings her Child on her
                    Back; so the Infant’s Back is towards hers, and its Face looks up towards the
                    Sky. If it rains, she throws her Leather or <sic>Woollen</sic> Match-coat, over her Head, which covers the Child all over, and
                    secures her and it from the Injuries of rainy Weather. The Savage Women quit all
                    Company, and dress not their own Victuals, during their Purgations.</p>
                <p n="49">After they have had several Children, they grow strangely out of Shape in their
                    Bodies; As for Barrenness, I never knew any of their Women, that have not

                    of their Money made of Shells. They often wear Bracelets made of Brass, and
                    sometimes of Iron Wire.</p>

                <p n="59">Their Money is of different sorts, but all made of Shells, which are found on the
                    Coast of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> which are very large and hard, so
                    that they are very difficult to cut. Some <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Smiths
                    have try’d to drill this sort of Shell-Money, and thereby thought to get an
                    Advantage; but it prov’d so hard, that nothing could be gain’d. They often times
                    make, of this Shell, a sort of Gorge, which they wear about their Neck in a
                    string; so it hangs on their Collar, whereon sometimes is <sic>engraven</sic> a Cross, or some odd sort of Figure, which comes next in their Fancy.
                    There are other sorts valued at a Doe-Skin, yet the Gorges will sometimes sell
                    for three or four Buck-Skins ready <sic>drest</sic>. There be others, that eight of them go readily for a Doe Skin; but
                    the general and current Species of all the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> in
                        <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and, I believe, all over <pb n="194" xml:id="p194"/> the Continent, as far as the Bay of <hi rend="italics">Mexico,</hi> is that which we call <hi rend="italics">Peak,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Ronoak;</hi> but <hi rend="italics">Peak</hi> more
                    especially. This is that which at <hi rend="italics">New-York,</hi> they call
                        <hi rend="italics">Wanspum,</hi> and have used it as current Money amongst
                    the Inhabitants for a great many Years. This is what many Writers call <hi rend="italics"><sic>Porcelan</sic>,</hi> and is made at <hi rend="italics">New-York</hi> in great
                    Quantities, and with us in some measure. Five Cubits of this purchase a dress’d
                    Doe-Skin, and seven or eight purchase a dress’d Buck-Skin. An <hi rend="italics">English</hi>-man could not afford to make so much of this <hi rend="italics">Wampum</hi> for five or ten times the Value; for it is made
                    out of a vast great Shell, of which that Country affords Plenty; where it is
                    ground smaller than the small End of a Tobacco-Pipe, or a large Wheat-Straw.
                    Four or five of these make an Inch, and every one is to be drill’d through, and
                    made as smooth as Glass, and so strung, as Beds are, and a Cubit of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Measure contains as much in Length, as will reach
                    from the Elbow to the End of the little Finger. They never stand to question,
                    whether it is a tall Man, or a short one, that measures it; but if this <hi rend="italics">Wampum Peak</hi> be black or purple, as some Part of that
                    Shell is, then it is twice the Value. This the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    grind on Stones and other things, till they make it current, but the Drilling is
                    the most difficult to the <hi rend="italics">English</hi>-men, which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> manage with a Nail stuck in a Cane or Reed. Thus
                    they roll it continually on their Thighs, with their Right-hand, holding the Bit
                    of Shell with their Left, so in time they drill a Hole quite through it, which
                    is a very tedious Work; but especially in making their <hi rend="italics">Ronoak,</hi> four of which will scarce make one Length of <hi rend="italics">Wampum.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are a People
                    that never value their time, so that they can afford to make them, and never
                    need to fear the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> will take the Trade out of
                    their Hands. This is the Money with which you may buy Skins, Furs, Slaves, or
                    any thing the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have; it being the Mammon (as our
                    Money is to us) that entices and persuades them to do any thing, and part with
                    every thing they possess, except their Children for Slaves. As for their Wives,
                    they are often sold, and their Daughters violated for it. With this they buy off
                    Murders; and whatsoever a Man can do that is ill, this <hi rend="italics">Wampum</hi> will quit him of, and make him, in their Opinion, good and <sic>vertuous</sic>, though never so black before.</p>

                    Expressions of Joy, to consummate this horrid and barbarous Feast, which is
                    carried on after this dismal Manner. First, they bring the Prisoner to the Place
                    appointed for the Execution, where he is set down on his Breech on the Ground.
                    Then they all get about him, and you shall not see one sorrowful or dejected
                    Countenance amongst them, but all very merrily dispos’d, as is some Comedy was
                    to be acted, instead of a Tragedy. He that is appointed to be the chief
                    Executioner, takes a Knife, and bids him hold out his Hands, which he does, and
                    then cuts round the Wrist through the Skin, which is drawn off like a Glove, and <sic>flead</sic> quite off at the Fingers Ends; then they break his Joints and Bones,
                    and buffet and torment him after a very inhumane Manner, till some violent Blow
                    perhaps ends his Days; then they burn him to Ashes, and throw them down the
                    River. Afterwards they eat, drink and are merry, repeating all the Actions of
                    the Tormentors and the Prisoner, with a great deal of Mirth and Satisfaction.
                    This Accusation is laid against an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    <sic>Heroe</sic> sometimes wrongfully, or when they have a mind to get rid of a Man
                    that has more Courage and Conduct than his neighbouring Kings or great Men; then

                    and make a Rehearsal of every <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> that died for a

                    against the said Person, and by such means make him away presently. In some

                    time with a great deal of Patience, to bring about their Designs; they being

                    Temper, I will proceed; and can give you no other Character of them, but that
                    they are a very wary People, and are <pb n="197" xml:id="p197"/> never hasty or
                    impatient. They will endure a great many Misfortunes, Losses, and <sic>Disapointments</sic> without <sic>shewing</sic> themselves, in the least, vex’d or uneasy. When they go by Water, if
                    there proves a Head-Wind, they never vex and fret as the <hi rend="italics">Europeans</hi> do, and let what Misfortune come to them, as will or can
                    happen, they never relent. Besides, there is one Vice very common every where,
                    which I never found amongst them, which is Envying other Mens Happiness, because
                    their Station is not equal to, or above, their Neighbours. Of this Sin I cannot
                    say I ever saw an Example, though they are a People that set as great a Value
                    upon themselves, as any sort of Men in the World; upon which Account they find
                    something Valuable in themselves above Riches. Thus, he that is a good Warriour,
                    is the proudest Creature living; and he that is an expert Hunter, is esteem’d by
                    the People and himself; yet all these are natural Vertues and Gifts, and not
                    Riches, which are as often in the Possession of a Fool as a Wife-man. Several of
                    the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are possess’d of a great many Skins, <hi rend="italics">Wampum,</hi> Ammunition, and what other things are esteem’d
                    Riches amongst them; yet such an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> is no more
                    esteem’d amongst them, than any other ordinary Fellow, provided he has no
                    personal Endowments, which are the Ornaments that must gain him an Esteem among
                    them; for a great Dealer, amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> is no
                    otherwise respected and esteemed, than as a Man that strains his Wits, and
                    fatigues himself, to furnish others with Necessaries of Life, that live much
                    easier and enjoy more of the World, than he himself does with all his Pelf. If
                    they are taken Captives, and expect a miserable Exit, they sing; if Death
                    approach them in Sickness, they are not afraid of it; nor are ever heard to say,
                    Grant me some time. They know by Instinct, and daily Example, that they must
                    die; wherefore, they have that great and noble Gift to submit to every thing
                    that happens, and value nothing that attacks them.</p>
                <p n="65">Their Cruelty to their Prisoners of War is what they are seemingly guilty of an
                    Error in, (I mean as to a natural Failing) because they strive to invent the
                    most inhumane Butcheries for them, that the Devils themselves could invent, or
                    hammer out of Hell; they esteeming Death no Punishment, but rather an Advantage

                    from that Way of Living, by any Argument that can be used. If you go to persuade

                    which they have ever been used to; and that if Peace be made with the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> they now war withal, they must find out some
                    others to wage War against; for, for them to live in Peace, is to live out of
                    their Element, War, Conquest, and Murder, being what they delight in, and value
                    themselves for. When they take a Slave, and intend to keep him to Work in their

                    very politick, in waging, and carrying on their, War, first by advising with all
                    the ancient Men of Conduct and Reason, that belong to their Nation; such as
                    superannuated War-Captains, and those that have been Counsellors for many Years,
                    and whose Advice has commonly succeeded very well. They have likewise their
                    Field Counsellors, who are accustomed to Ambuscades, and Surprizes, which
                    Methods are commonly used by the Savages; for I scarce ever heard of a
                    Field-Battle fought amongst them.</p>

                <p n="68">One of their Expeditions afforded an Instance, worthy mention, which was thus;
                    Two Nations of <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> here in <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> were at War together, and a Party of each were in the Forest
                    ranging to see what Enemies they could take. The lesser Number found they were
                    discover’d, and could not well get over a River (that lay betwixt them and their
                    home) without engaging the other Party, whose Numbers were much the greater; so
                    they call’d a Council, which met, and having weigh’d their present Circumstances
                    with a great deal of Argument and Debate, for a considerable time, and found
                    their Enemies Advantage, and that they could expect no Success in Engaging such
                    an unequal Number; they, at last, concluded on this Stratagem, which, in my
                    Opinion, carried a great deal of Policy along with it. It was, That the same
                    Night, they should make a great Fire, which they were certain would be
                    discover’d by the adverse Party, and there dress up Logs of Wood in their
                    Cloaths, and make them exactly seem like <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that
                    were asleep by the Fireside; (which is their Way, when in the Woods) so, <hi rend="italics">said they,</hi> our Enemies will sire upon these Images,
                    supposing them to be us, who will lie in Ambuscade, and, after their Guns are
                    unloaded, shall deal well enough with them. This Result was immediately put in
                    Execution, and the Fire was made by the side of a Valley, where they lay perdu
                    very advantageously. Thus, a little before Break of Day, (which commonly is the
                    Hour they surprize their Enemies in) the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi>
                    <pb n="200" xml:id="p200"/> came down to their Fire, and at once fired in upon
                    those Logs in the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> Cloaths, and run up to them,
                    expecting they had kill’d every Man dead; but they found themselves mistaken,
                    for then the other <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> who had lain all the Night
                    stark-naked in the Bottom, attack’d them with their loaded Pieces, which so
                    surprized them, that every Man was taken Prisoner, and brought in bound to their
                    Town.</p>

                    the <hi rend="italics">Coranine’s,</hi> on the Sand-Banks; which was as follows.
                    The <hi rend="italics">Machapungas</hi> were invited to a Feast, by the <hi rend="italics">Coranines;</hi> (which two Nations had been a long time at

                        <hi rend="italics">Coranines</hi> Feast, which was to avoid all Suspicion,
                    and their King, who, of a Savage, is a great Politician and very stout, order’d
                    all his Men to carry their <hi rend="italics"><sic>Tamahauks</sic></hi> along with them, hidden under their Match-Coats, which they
                    did; and being acquainted when to fall on, by the Word given, they all (upon
                    this Design) set forward for the Feast, and came to the <hi rend="italics">Coramue</hi> Town, where they had gotten Victuals, Fruit, and such things
                    as make an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Entertainment, all ready to make these
                    new Friends welcome, which they did; and, after Dinner, towards the Evening, (as
                    it is customary amongst them) they went to Dancing, all together; so when the
                        <hi rend="italics">Machapunga</hi> King saw the best Opportunity offer, he
                    gave the Word, and his Men pull’d their <hi rend="italics">Tamahauks</hi> or
                    Hatchets from under their Match-Coats, and kill’d several, and took the rest
                    Prisoners, except some few that were not present, and about four or five that
                    escap’d. The Prisoners they sold Slaves to the <hi rend="italics">English.</hi>
                    At the time this was done, those <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> had nothing but

                    unconstant, unless they are Eye-witnesses thereof. They are generally very
                    bashful, especially the young Maids, who when they come into a strange Cabin,
                    where they are not acquainted, never ask for any thing, though never so hungry
                    or thirsty, but sit down, without speaking a Word (be it never so long) till
                    some of the House asks them a Question, or falls into Discourse, with the
                    Stranger. I never saw a Scold amongst them, and to their Children they are
                    extraordinary tender and indulgent; neither did I ever see a Parent correct a
                    Child, excepting one Woman, that was the King’s Wife, and she (indeed) did
                    possess a Temper that is not commonly found amongst them. They are free from all
                    manner of Compliments, except Shaking of Hands, and Scratching on the Shoulder,
                    which two are the greatest Marks of Sincerity and Friendship, that can be <sic>shew’d</sic> one to another. They cannot express <hi rend="italics">fare you
                        well,</hi> but when they leave the House, will say, <hi rend="italics">I go
                        straightway,</hi> which is to intimate their Departure; and if the Man of
                    the House has any Message to send by the going Man, he may acquaint him
                    therewith. Their Tongue allows not to say, <hi rend="italics">Sir, I am your
                        Servants;</hi> because they have no different Titles for Man, only King,
                    War-Captain, Old Man, or Young Man, which respect the Stations and Circumstances
                    Men are employ’d in, and arriv’d to, and not Ceremony. As for Servant, they have
                    no such thing, except Slave, and their Dogs, Cats, tame or Domestick Beasts, and
                    Birds, are call’d by the same Name: For the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Word
                    for Slave includes them all. So when an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> tells you
                    he has got a Slave for you, it may (in general Terms, as they use) be a young
                    Eagle, a Dog, Otter, or any other thing of that Nature, which is obsequiously to
                    depend on the Master for its Sustenance.</p>

                <p n="72">They are never fearful in the Night, nor do the Thoughts of Spirits ever trouble
                    them; such as the many Hobgoblins and Bugbears that we suck in with our Milk,
                    and the Foolery of our Nurses and Servants suggest to us; who by their idle
                    Tales of Fairies, and Witches, make such Impressions on our tender Years, that

                <p n="73">Not but that the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have as many Lying Stories of
                    Spirits and Conjurers, as any People in the World; but they tell it with no
                    Disadvantage to themselves; for the great Esteem which the Old Men bring
                    themselves to, is by making the others believe their Familiarity with Devils and
                    Spirits, and how great a Correspondence they have therewith, which if it once
                    gains Credit, they ever after are held in the greatest Veneration imaginable,
                    and whatever they after impose upon the People, is receiv’d as infallible. They
                    are so little startled at the Thoughts of another World, that they not seldom
                    murder themselves; as for Instance, a <hi rend="italics">Bear</hi>-River <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> a very likely young Fellow, about twenty Years
                    of Age, whose Mother was angry at his drinking of too much Rum, and chid him for
                    it, thereupon reply’d, he would have her satisfied, and he would do the like no
                    more; upon which he made his Words good; for he went aside, and shot himself
                    dead. This was a Son of the politick King of the <hi rend="italics">Machapunga,</hi> I spoke of before, and has the most Cunning of any <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> I ever met withal.</p>
                <p n="74">Most of the Savages are much addicted to Drunkenness, a Vice they never were
                    acquainted with, till the Christians came amongst them. Some of them refrain
                    drinking strong Liquors, but very few of that sort are found amongst them. Their
                    chief Liquor is Rum, without any Mixture. This the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> bring amongst them, and buy Skins, Furs, Slaves and other of
                    their Commodities therewith. They never are contented with a little, but when
                    once begun, they must make themselves quite drunk; otherwise they will never
                    rest, but sell all they have in the World, rather than not have their full Dose.
                    In these drunken <sic>Frolicks</sic>, (which are always carried on in the Night) they sometimes murder one
                    another, fall into the Fire, fall down Precipices, and break their Necks, with
                    several other Misfortunes which this drinking of Rum brings upon them; and tho’
                    they are sensible of it, yet they have no Power to refrain this Enemy. About
                    five years ago, when <hi rend="italics">Landgrave Daniel</hi> was Governour, he
                    summon’d in all the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Kings and Rulers to meet, and
                    in a full Meeting of the Government and Council, with those <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> they agreed upon a firm Peace, and the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Rulers desired <pb n="203" xml:id="p203"/> no Rum might be sold
                    to them, which was granted, and a Law made, that inflicted a Penalty on those
                    that sold Rum to the Heathens; but it was never strictly observ’d, and besides,
                    the young <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> were so disgusted at that Article,
                    that they <sic>threatned</sic> to kill the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> that made it, unless it
                    was laid aside, and they might have Rum sold them, when they went to the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Englishmens</sic></hi> Houses to buy it.</p>
                <p n="75">Some of the Heathens are so very poor, that they have no Manner of Cloaths, save
                    a Wad of Moss to hide their Nakedness. These are either lusty and will not work;
                    otherwise, they are given to Gaming or Drunkenness; yet these get Victuals as
                    well as the rest, because that is common amongst them, If they are caught in
                    theft they are Slaves till they repay the Person, (as <sic>Imention’d</sic> before) but to steal from the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> they
                    reckon no Harm. Not but that I have known some few Savages that have been as
                    free from Theft as any of the Christians. When they have a Design to lie with a
                    Woman, which they cannot obtain any otherwise than by a larger Reward than they
                    are able to give, they then strive to make her drunk, which a great many of them
                    will be; then they take the Advantage, to do with them what they please, and
                    sometimes in their Drunkenness, cut off their Hair and sell it to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> which is the greatest Affront can be offer’d
                    them. They never value Time; for if they be going out to hunt, fish, or any
                    other indifferent Business, you may keep them in talk as long as you please, so
                    you but keep them in Discourse, and seem pleased with their Company; yet none
                    are more expeditious and safer Messengers than they, when any extraordinary
                    Business that they are sent about requires it.</p>

                <p n="78">Besides, they have Names for eight of the thirty two Points, and call the Winds
                    by their several Names, as we do; but indeed more properly, for the North-West
                    Wind is called the cold Wind; the North-East the wet Wind; the South the warm
                    Wind; and so agreeably of the rest. Sometimes it happens, that they have a large
                    River or Lake to pass over, and the Weather is very foggy, as it often happens
                    in the Spring and Fall of the Leaf; so that they cannot see which Course to
                    steer: In such a Case, they being on one side of the River, or Lake, they know
                    well enough what Course such a Place (which they intend for) bears from them.
                    Therefore, they get a great many Sticks and Chunks of Wood in their Canoe, and
                    then set off directly for their Port, and now and then throw over a Piece of
                    Wood, which directs them, by seeing how the Stick bears from the Canoes Stern,
                    which they always observe to keep right aft; and this is the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Compass by which they will go over a broad Water of ten or
                    twenty Leagues wide. They will find the Head of any River, though it is five six
                    or seven hundred miles off, and they never were there, in their Lives before; as
                    is often prov’d, by their appointing to meet on the Head of such a River, where
                    perhaps, none of them ever was before, but where they shall rendezvous exactly
                    at the <sic>prefixt</sic> time; and if they meet with any Obstruction, they leave certain Marks
                    in the Way, where they that come after will understand how many have pass’d by
                    already, and which way they are gone. <pb n="205" xml:id="p205"/> Besides, in
                    their War Expeditions, they have very certain <sic>Hieroglyphicks</sic>, whereby each Party informs the other of the Success or Losses they
                    have met withal; all which is so exactly perform’d by their <sic>Sylvian</sic> Marks and Characters, that they are never at a Loss to understand one
                    another. Yet there was never found any Letters amongst the Savages of <hi rend="italics">Carolina;</hi> nor, I believe, among any other Natives in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> that were possess’d with any manner of Writing
                    or Learning throughout all the Discoveries of the New-World. They will draw
                    Maps, very exactly, of all the Rivers, Towns, Mountains, and Roads, or what you
                    shall enquire of them, which you may draw by their Directions, and come to a
                    small matter of Latitude, reckoning by their Days Journeys. These Maps they will
                    draw in the Ashes of the Fire, and sometimes upon a Mat or Piece of Bark. I have
                    put a Pen and Ink into a Savage’s Hand, and he has drawn me the Rivers, Bays,
                    and other Parts of a Country, which afterwards I have found to agree with a
                    great deal of Nicety: But you must be very much in their Favour, otherwise they
                    will never make these Discoveries to you; especially, if it be in their own
                    Quarters. And as for Mines of Silver and other Metals, we are satisfied we have <sic>enow</sic>, and those very rich, in <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> and its
                    adjacent Parts; some of which the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are acquainted
                    withal, although no <sic>Enquirers</sic> thereafter, but what came, and were discover’d, by Chance; yet they
                    say, it is this Metal that the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> covet, as they do
                    their <hi rend="italics">Peak</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Ronoak;</hi> and that
                    we have gain’d Ground of them wherever we have come. Now, say they, if we should
                    discover these Minerals to the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> they would
                    settle at or near these Mountains, and bereave us of the best Hunting-Quarters
                    we have, as they have already done wherever they have inhabited; so by that
                    means, we shall be driven to some unknown Country, to live, hunt, and get our
                    Bread in. These are the Reasons that the Savages give, for not making known what
                    they are acquainted withal, of that Nature. And indeed, all Men that have ever
                    gone upon those Discoveries, allow them to be good; more especially, my
                    ingenious Friend Mr. <hi rend="italics">Francis-Louis Mitchell,</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Bern</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Switzerland,</hi> who has
                    been, for several Years, very indefatigable and strict in his Discoveries
                    amongst those vast Ledges of Mountains, and spacious Tracts of Land, lying
                    towards the Heads of the great Bays and <pb n="206" xml:id="p206"/> Rivers of
                        <hi rend="italics">Virginia, Maryland,</hi> and <hi rend="italics"><sic>Pensylvania</sic>,</hi> where he has discover’d a spacious Country inhabited by none
                    but the Savages, and not many of them; who yet are of a very friendly Nature to
                    the Christians. This Gentleman has been employ’d by the Canton of <hi rend="italics">Bern,</hi> to find out a Tract of Land in the <hi rend="italics">English America,</hi> where that Republick might settle some
                    of their People; which Proposal, I believe, is now in a fair way towards a <sic>Conclusron</sic>, between her Majesty of <hi rend="italics">Great-Britain</hi> and that
                    Canton. Which must needs be of great Advantage to both; and as for ourselves, I
                    believe, no Man that is in his Wits, and understands the Situation and Affairs
                    of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> but will allow, nothing can be of more
                    Security and Advantage to the Crown and Subjects of <hi rend="italics">Great-Britain,</hi> than to have our Frontiers secured by a warlike People,
                    and our Friends, as the <hi rend="italics">Switzers</hi> are; especially when we
                    have more <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> than we can civilize, and so many
                    Christian Enemies lying on the back of us, that we do not know how long or short
                    a time it may be, before they visit us. Add to these, the Effects and Product
                    that may be expected from those Mountains; which may hereafter prove of great
                    Advantage to the <hi rend="italics">British</hi> Monarchy, and none more fit
                    than an industrious People, bred in a mountainous Country, and inur’d to all the
                    Fatigues of War and Travel, to improve a Country. Thus we have no room to doubt,
                    but as soon as any of those Parts are seated by the <hi rend="italics">Switzers,</hi> a great many <hi rend="italics"><sic>Britains</sic></hi> will strive to live amongst them, for the Benefit of the
                    sweet Air and healthful Climate, which that Country affords, were it only for
                    the Cultivating of Hemp, Flax, Wine, and other valuable Staples, which those
                    People are fully acquainted withal: Not to mention the Advantages already
                    discover’d by that worthy Gentleman I just now spoke of, who is highly deserving
                    of the Conduct and Management of such an Affair, as that wife Canton has
                    entrusted him withal.</p>

                <p n="79">When these Savages go a hunting, they commonly go out in great Numbers, and
                    oftentimes a great many Days Journey from home, beginning at the coming in of
                    the Winter; that is, when the Leaves are fallen from the Trees, and are become
                    dry. ’Tis then they burn the Woods, by setting Fire to the Leaves, and wither’d
                    Bent and Grass, which they do with a Match made of the black Moss that hangs on
                    the Trees in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and is sometimes above six Foot
                    long. This, when <pb n="207" xml:id="p207"/>

                    and will then hold Fire as well as the best Match we have in <hi rend="italics">Europe.</hi> In Places, where this Moss is not found, (as towards the
                    Mountains) they make Lintels of the Bark of Cypress beaten, which serve as well.
                    Thus they go and fire the Woods for many Miles, and drive the Deer and other
                    Game into small Necks of Land and Isthmus’s, where they kill and destroy what
                    they please. In these Hunting-Quarters, they have their Wives and Ladies of the
                    Camp, where they eat all the Fruits and Dainties of that Country, and live in
                    all the Mirth and Jollity, which it is possible for such People to entertain
                    themselves withal. Here it is, that they get their Complement of Deer-Skins and
                    Furs to trade with the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> (the Deer-Skins being in
                    Season in Winter, which is contrary to <hi rend="italics">England.</hi>) All
                    small Game, as Turkeys, Ducks, and small Vermine, they commonly kill with Bow
                    and Arrow, thinking it not worth throwing Powder and Shot after them. Of Turkeys
                    they have abundance; especially, in Oak-Land, as most of it is, that lies any
                    distance backwards. I have been often in their Hunting-Quarters, where a roasted
                    or <sic>barbakued</sic> Turkey, eaten with Bears Fat, is held a good Dish; and indeed, I
                    approve of it very well; for the Bears Grease is the sweetest and least
                    offensive to the Stomach (as I said before) of any Fat of Animals I ever tasted.
                    The Savage Men never beat their Corn to make Bread; but that is the <sic>Womens</sic> Work, especially the Girls, of whom you shall see four beating with
                    long great <sic>Pestils</sic> in a narrow wooden Mortar; and every one keeps her Stroke so exactly,
                    that ’tis worthy of Admiration. Their Cookery continues from Morning till Night.
                    The Hunting makes them hungry; and the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are a
                    People that always eat very often, not seldom getting up at Midnight, to eat.
                    They plant a great many sorts of Pulse, Part of which they eat green in the
                    Summer, keeping great Quantities for their Winter-Store, which they carry along
                    with them into the Hunting-Quarters, and eat them.</p>
                <p n="80">The small red Pease is very common with them, and they eat a great deal of that
                    and other sorts boil’d with their Meat, or eaten with Bears Fat, which Food
                    makes them break Wind backwards, which the Men frequently do, and laugh heartily
                    at it, it being accounted no ill Manners amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians:</hi> Yet the Women are more modest, than to follow that ill

                    Cabins, and other Servile Work; also to go backward and forward, to their Towns,
                    to carry News to the old People, whom they leave behind them. The Women are
                    forced to carry their Loads of Grain and other Provisions, and get Fire-Wood;
                    for a good Hunter, or Warriour in these Expeditions, is employ’d in no other
                    Business, than the Affairs of Game and Battle. The wild Fruits which are dry’d
                    in the Summer, over Fires, on Hurdles and in the Sun, are now brought into the
                    Field; as are likewise the Cakes and Quiddonies of Peaches, and that Fruit and
                    Bilberries dry’d, of which they stew and make Fruit-Bread and Cakes. In some
                    parts, where Pigeons are plentiful, they get of their Fat enough to supply their
                    Winter Stores. Thus they abide in these Quarters, all the Winter long, till the
                    Time approach for planting their Maiz and other Fruits. In these quarters, at
                    Spare-hours, the Women make Baskets and Mats to lie upon, and those that are not
                    extraordinary Hunters, make Bowls, Dishes, and Spoons, of Gum-wood, and the
                    Tulip-Tree; others (where they find a Vein of white Clay, fit for their purpose,
                    make Tobacco-pipes, all which are often transported to other <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that perhaps have greater Plenty of Deer and other Game; so
                    they buy (with these Manufactures) their raw Skins, with the Hair on, which our
                    neighbouring <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> bring to their Towns, and, in the
                    Summer-time, make The Slaves and sorry Hunters dress them, the Winter-Sun being
                    not strong enough to dry them; and those that are dry’d in the Cabins are black
                    and nasty with the Lightwood Smoke, which they commonly burn. Their Way of
                    dressing their Skins is by soaking them in Water, so they get the Hair off, with
                    an Instrument made of the Bone of a Deer’s Foot; yet some use a sort of Iron
                    Drawing-Knife, which they purchase of the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and
                    after the Hair is off, they dissolve <sic>Deer’s Brains</sic>, (which beforehand are made in a Cake and baked in the Embers) in a
                    Bowl of Water, so soak the Skins therein, till the Brains have suck’d up the
                    Water; then they dry it gently, and keep working it with an Oyster-Shell, or
                    some such thing, to withal, till it is dry; whereby it becomes soft and pliable.
                    Yet these so dress’d will not endure wet, <pb n="209" xml:id="p209"/>

                    hard thereby; which to prevent, they either cure them in the Smoke, or tan them
                    with Bark, as before observ’d; not but that young <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    Corn, beaten to a Pulp, will effect the same as the Brains. They are not only
                    good Hunters of the wild Beasts and Game of the Forest, but very expert in
                    taking the Fish of the Rivers and Waters near which they inhabit, and are
                    acquainted withal. Thus they that live a great way up the Rivers practise
                    Striking Sturgeon and Rock-fish, or Bass, when they come up the Rivers to spawn;
                    besides the vast Shoals of Sturgeon which they kill and take with Snares, as we
                    do Pike in <hi rend="italics">Europe.</hi> The Herrings in <hi rend="italics">March</hi> and <hi rend="italics">April</hi> run a great way up the Rivers
                    and fresh Streams to spawn, where the Savages make great Wares, with Hedges that
                    hinder their Passage only in the Middle, where an artificial Pound is made to
                    take them in; so that they cannot return. This Method is in use all over the
                    fresh Streams, to catch Trout and the other Species of Fish which those Parts
                    afford. Their taking of Craw-fish is so pleasant, that I cannot pass it by
                    without mention; When they have a mind to get these Shell-fish, they take a
                    Piece of Venison, and <sic>half-barbakue</sic> or roast it; then they cut it into thin Slices, which Slices they
                    stick through with Reeds about six Inches asunder, betwixt Piece and Piece; then
                    the Reeds are made sharp at one end; and so they stick a great many of them down
                    in the bottom of the Water (thus baited) in the small Brooks and Runs, which the
                    Craw-fish frequent. Thus the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> sit by, and tend
                    those baited Sticks, every now and then taking them up, to see how many are at
                    the Bait; where they generally find abundance; so take them off, and put them in
                    a Basket for the purpose, and stick the Reeds down again. By this Method, they
                    will, in a little time, catch several Bushels, which are as good, as any I ever
                    eat. Those <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> that frequent the Salt-Waters, take
                    abundance of Fish, some very large, and of several sorts, which to preserve,
                    they first <sic>barbakue</sic>, then pull the Fish to Pieces, so dry it in the Sun, whereby it keeps
                    for Transportation; as for Scate, Oysters, Cockles, and several sorts of
                    Shell-fish, they open and dry them upon Hurdles, having a constant Fire under
                    them. The Hurdles are made of Reeds or Canes in the shape of a Gridiron. Thus
                    they dry several Bushels of these Fish, and keep them for their Necessities. At

                    Fishery, that is for a little Shell-fish, which those in <hi rend="italics">England</hi> call Blackmoors Teeth. These they catch by tying Bits of
                    Oysters to a long String, which they lay in such places, as, they know, those
                    Shell-Fish haunt. These Fish get hold of the Oysters, and suck them in, so that
                    they pull up those long Strings, and take great Quantities of them, which they
                    carry a great way into the main Land, to trade with the remote <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> where they are of great Value; but never near
                    the Sea, by reason they are common, therefore not esteem’d. Besides, the Youth
                    and <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Boys go in the Night, and one holding a
                    Lightwood Torch, the other has a Bow and Arrows, and the Fire directing him to
                    see the Fish, he shoots them with the Arrows; and thus they kill a great many of
                    the smaller Fry, and sometimes pretty large ones. It is an establish’d Custom
                    amongst all these Natives, that the young Hunter never eats of that Buck, Bear,
                    Fish, or any other Game, which happens to be the first they kill of that sort;
                    because they believe, if he should eat thereof, he would never after be
                    fortunate in Hunting. The like foolish Ceremony they hold, when they have made a
                    Ware to take Fish withal; if a big-belly’d Woman eat of the first Dish that is
                    caught in it, they say, that Ware will never take much Fish; and as for killing
                    of Snakes, they avoid it, if they lie in their way, because their Opinion is,
                    that some of the Serpents Kindred would kill some of the Savages Relations, that
                    should destroy him: They have thousands of these foolish Ceremonies and Beliefs,
                    which they are strict Observers of. Moreover, several Customs are found in some
                    Families, which others keep not; as for Example, two Families of the <hi rend="italics">Machapunga Indians,</hi> use the <hi rend="italics">Jewish</hi> Custom of Circumcision, and the rest do not; neither did I ever
                    know any others amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> that practis’d any
                    such thing; and perhaps, if you ask them, what is the Reason they do so, they
                    will make you no Manner of Answer; which is as much as to say, I will not tell
                    you. Many other Customs they have, for which they will render no Reason or
                    Account; and to pretend to give a true Description of their Religion, it is
                    impossible; for there are a great many of their Absurdities, which, for some
                    Reason, they reserve as a Secret amongst themselves; or other-wise, they are
                    jealous of their Weakness in the practising <pb n="211" xml:id="p211"/> them; so
                    that they never acquaint any Christian with the Knowledge thereof, let Writers
                    pretend what they will; for I have known them amongst their Idols and dead Kings
                    in their <hi rend="italics">Quiogozon</hi> for several Days, where I could never
                    get Admittance, to see what they were doing, though I was at great Friendship
                    with the King and great Men; but all my Persuasions avail’d me nothing. Neither
                    were any but the King, with the Conjurer, and some few old Men, in that House;
                    as for the young Men, and chiefest Numbers of the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> they were kept as ignorant of what the Elders were doing, as

                <p n="81">They all believe, that this World is round, and that there are two Spirits; the
                    one good, the other bad: The good one they reckon to be the Author and Maker of
                    every thing, and say, that it is he, that gives them the Fruits of the Earth,
                    and has taught them to hunt, fish, and be wise enough to overpower the Beasts of
                    the Wilderness, and all other Creatures, that they may be assistant, and
                    beneficial to Man; to which they add, that the <hi rend="italics">Quera,</hi> or
                    good Spirit, has been very kind to the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Men, to
                    teach them to make Guns, and Ammunition, besides a great many other Necessaries,
                    that are helpful to Man, all which, they say, will be deliver’d to them, when
                    that good Spirit sees fit. They do not believe, that God punishes any Man either
                    in this Life, or that to come; but that he delights in doing good, and in giving
                    the Fruits of the Earth, and instructing us in making several useful and
                    ornamental things. They say, it is a bad Spirit (who lives separate from the
                    good one) that torments us with Sicknesses, Disappointments, Losses, Hunger,
                    Travel, and all the Misfortunes, that Humane Life is incident to. How they are
                    treated in the next World, I have already mention’d, and, as I said before, they
                    are very resolute in dying, when in the Hands of Savage Enemies; yet I saw one
                    of their young Men, a very likely Person, condemn’d, on a <hi rend="italics">Sunday,</hi> for Killing a Negro, and burning the House. I took good Notice
                    of his Behaviour, when he was brought out of the House to die, which was the
                    next Morning after Sentence, but he chang’d his Countenance with Trembling, and
                    was in the greatest Fear and Agony. I never saw any Person under his
                    Circumstances, which, perhaps, might be occasion’d by his being deliver’d up by
                    his own Nation (which was the <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro’s</hi>) <pb n="212" xml:id="p212"/> and executed by us, that are not their common Enemies,
                    though he met with more Favour than he would have receiv’d at the Hands of
                    Savages; for he was only hang’d on a Tree, near the Place where the Murder was
                    committed; and the three Kings, that but the day before <sic>shew’d</sic> such a Reluctancy to deliver him up, (but would have given another in
                    his Room) when he was hang’d, pull’d him by the Hand, and said, <hi rend="italics">Thou wilt never play any more Rogues Tricks in this World;
                        whither art thou gone to <sic>shew</sic> thy Tricks now?</hi> Which <sic>shews</sic> these Savages to be what they really are, (<hi rend="italics">viz</hi>) a People that will save their own Men if they can, but if the Safety
                    of all the People lies at Stake, they will deliver up the most innocent Person
                    living, and be so far from Concern, when they have made themselves easy thereby,
                    that they will laugh at their Misfortunes, and never pity or think of them

                <p n="82">Their Priests are the Conjurers and Doctors of the Nation. I shall mention some
                    of their Methods, and Practices; and so leave them to the Judgment of the
                    Reader. As I told you before, the Priests make their Orations at every Feast, or
                    other great Meeting of the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> I happen’d to be at
                    one of these great Meetings, which was at the Funeral of a Tuskeruro Indian,
                    that was slain with Lightning at a Feast, the day before, where I was amongst
                    the rest; it was in <hi rend="italics">July,</hi> and a very fair day, where, in
                    the Afternoon, about six or seven a Clock, as they were dealing out their
                    Victuals, there appear’d a little black Cloud to the North West, which spread
                    and brought with it Rain, Wind and Lightning; so we went out from the Place
                    where we were all at Victuals, and went down to the Cabins where I left the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and went to lie in my Canoe, which was
                    convenient enough to keep me dry. The Lightning came so terrible, and down in
                    long Streams, that I was afraid it would have taken hold of a Barrel of Powder I
                    had in my Vessel, and so blown me up; but it pleas’d God, that it did me no
                    Harm; yet the Violence of the Wind had blown all the Water away, where I rid at
                    Anchor, so that my Canoe lay dry, and some <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Women
                    came with Torches in their Hands to the side of the Canoe, and told me, an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> was kill’d with Lightning. The next day, (I
                    think) he was buried, and I stay’d to see the Ceremony, and was very tractable
                    to help the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> to trim their Reeds, and make the
                    Coffin, which pleased them very much, being <pb n="213" xml:id="p213"/> because
                    I had a mind to see the Interment. Before he was Interr’d according to their
                    Custom, they dealt every one some hot Victuals, which he took and did what he
                    would with: Then the Doctor began to talk, and told the People what Lightning
                    was, and that it kill’d every thing that dwelt upon the Earth; nay, the very
                    Fishes did not escape; for it often reach’d the Porpoises and other Fish, and
                    destroy’d them; that every thing strove to shun it, except the Mice, who, he
                    said, were the busiest in eating their Corn in the Fields, when it lightned the
                    most. He added, that no Wood or Tree could withstand it, except the black Gum,
                    and that it would run round that Tree a great many times, to enter therein, but
                    could not effect it. Now you must understand, that sort of Gum will not split or
                    rive; therefore, I suppose, the Story might arise from thence. At last, he began
                    to tell the most ridiculous absurd Parcel of <sic>Lyes</sic> about Lightning, that could be; as that an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> of that Nation had once got Lightning in the Likeness of a
                    Partridge; That no other Lightning could harm him, whilst he had that about him;
                    and that after he had kept it for several Years, it got away from him; so that
                    he then became as liable to be struck with Lightning, as any other Person. There
                    was present at the same time, an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> that had liv’d
                    from his Youth, chiefly in an <hi rend="italics">English</hi> House; so I call’d
                    to him, and told him, what a Parcel of <sic>Lyes</sic> the Conjurer told, not doubting but he thought so, as well as I, but I
                    found to the contrary; for he reply’d, that I was much mistaken, for that old
                    Man (who, I believe was upwards of an hundred Years old) did never tell <sic>Lyes</sic>; and as for what he said, it was very true, for he knew it himself to
                    be so. Thereupon, seeing the Fellow’s Ignorance, I talk’d no more about it. Then
                    the Doctor proceeded to tell a long Tale of a great Rattle-Snake, which, a great
                    while ago, liv’d by a Creek in that River (which was <hi rend="italics">Neus</hi>) and that it kill’d abundance of <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi>
                    but at last, a bald Eagle kill’d it, and they were rid of a Serpent, that us’d
                    to devour whole Canoes full of <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> at a time. I
                    have been something tedious upon this Subject, on purpose to <sic>shew</sic> what strange ridiculous Stories these Wretches are inclinable to
                    believe. I suppose, these Doctors understand a little better themselves, than to
                    give Credit to any such Fooleries; for I reckon them the cunningest Knaves in
                    all the Pack. I will <pb n="214" xml:id="p214"/> therefore begin with their
                    Physick and Surgery, which is next: You must know, that the Doctors or
                    Conjurers, to gain a greater Credit amongst these People, tell them, that all
                    Distempers are the Effects of evil Spirits, or the bad Spirit, which has struck
                    them with this or that Malady; therefore, none of these Physicians undertakes
                    any Distemper, but that he comes to an Exorcism, to effect the Cure, and
                    acquaints the sick Party’s Friends, that he must converse with the good Spirit,
                    to know whether the Patient will recover or not; if so, then he will drive out
                    the bad Spirit, and the Patient will become well. Now, the general way of their
                    Behaviour in curing the Sick, (a great deal of which I have seen, and shall give
                    some Account thereof, in as brief a manner as possible) is, when an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> is sick, if they think there is much Danger of
                    Life, and that he is a great Man or hath good <sic>Frieds</sic>, the Doctor is sent for. As soon as the Doctor comes into the Cabin,
                    the sick Person is sat on a Mat or Skin, stark-naked, lying on his Back, and all
                    uncover’d, except some small Trifle that covers their Nakedness when ripe,
                    otherwise in very young Children, there is nothing about them. In this manner,
                    the Patient lies, when the Conjurer appears; and the King of that Nation comes
                    to attend him with a Rattle made of a Gourd with Pease in it. This the King
                    delivers into the Doctor’s Hand, whilst another brings a Bowl of Water, and sets
                    it down: Then the Doctor begins, and utters some few Words very softly;
                    afterwards he smells of the Patient’s Navel and Belly, and sometimes scarifies
                    him a little with a Flint, or an Instrument made of Rattle-Snakes Teeth for that
                    purpose; then he sucks the Patient, and gets out a Mouthful of Blood and <hi rend="italics">Serum,</hi> but <hi rend="italics">Serum</hi> chiefly; which,
                    perhaps, may be a better Method in many Cases, than to take away great
                    Quantities of Blood, as is commonly practis’d; which he spits in the Bowl of
                    Water. Then he begins to mutter, and talk apace, and, at last, to cut Capers,
                    and clap his Hands on his Breech and Sides, till he gets into a Sweat, so that a
                    Stranger would think he was running mad; now and then sucking the Patient, and
                    so, at times, keeps sucking, till he has got a great <sic>Quaatity</sic> of very ill-coloured Matter out of the Belly, Arms, Breast, Forehead,
                    Temples, Neck, and most Parts, still continuing his Grimaces, and antick
                    Postures, which are not to be match’d in <hi rend="italics">Bedlam:</hi> At
                    last, you will see the Doctor all over of a dropping Sweat, and <pb n="215" xml:id="p215"/> able to utter one Word, having quite spent himself; then he
                    will cease for a while, and so begin again, till he comes in the same Pitch of
                    Raving and seeming Madness, as before, (all this time the sick Body never so
                    much as moves, although, doubtless, the Lancing and Sucking must be a great
                    Punishment to them; but they, certainly, are the patientest and most steady
                    People under any Burden, that I ever saw in my Life.) At last, the Conjurer
                    makes an end, and tells the Patient’s Friends, whether the Person will live or
                    die; and then one that waits at this Ceremony, takes the Blood away, (which
                    remains in a Lump, in the middle of the Water) and buries it in the Ground, in a
                    Place unknown to any one, but he that inters it. Now, I believe a great deal of
                    Imposture in these Fellows; yet I never knew their Judgment fail, though I have
                    seen them give their Opinion after this Manner, several times: Some affirm, that
                    there is a smell of Brimstone in the Cabins, when they are Conjuring, which I
                    cannot contradict. Which way it may come, I will not argue, but proceed to a
                    Relation or two, which I have from a great many Persons, and some of them worthy
                    of Credit.</p>

                <p n="83">The first is, of a certain <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> that one rainy Night,
                    undermin’d a House made of Logs, (such as the <hi rend="italics">Swedes</hi> in
                        <hi rend="italics">America</hi> very often make, and are very strong) which
                    belong’d to <hi rend="italics">Seth Southwell,</hi> Esq; Governor of <hi rend="italics">North-Carolina,</hi> and one of the Proprietors. There was
                    but one place the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> could get in at, which was very
                    narrow; the rest was secur’d, by having Barrels of Pork and other Provisions set
                    against the side of the House, so that if this <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>
                    had not exactly hit the very Place he undermin’d, it had been impossible for him
                    to have got therein, because of the full Barrels that stood round the House, and <sic>barricadoed</sic> it within. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> stole sixty or eighty
                    dress’d Deer-Skins, besides Blankets, Powder, Shot and Rum, (this being the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Store-House, where the Trading Goods were kept.)
                    Now, the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> had made him Escape, but <sic>dropt</sic> some of the Skins by the way, and they track’d his Foot-steps, and
                    found him to be an <hi rend="italics">Indian;</hi> then they guess’d who it was,
                    because none but that <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> had lately been near the
                    House. Thereupon, the Governor sent to the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Town
                    that he belong’d to, which was the <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro</hi>'s, and
                    acquainted them that if they did not deliver up the <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> who had committed the <pb n="216" xml:id="p216"/> Robbery, he
                    would take a Course with them, that would not be very agreeable. Upon this, the
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> of the Town he belong’d to, brought him in
                    bound, and deliver’d him up to the Governor, who laid him in Irons. At the same
                    time, it happen’d, that a Robbery was committed amongst themselves, at the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Town, and this Prisoner was one of their
                    Conjurers; so the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> came down to the Governor’s
                    House, and acquainted him with what had happen’d amongst them, and that a great
                    Quantity of <hi rend="italics">Peak,</hi> was <sic>stoln</sic> away out of one of their Cabins, and no one could find out the Thief,
                    unless he would let the Prisoner conjure for it, who was the only Man they had
                    at making such Discoveries. The Governor was content he should try his Skill for
                    them, but not to have the Prisoners Irons taken off, which was very well
                    approved of. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> was brought out in his Fetters,
                    where were the Governor’s Family, and several others of the Neighbourhood, now
                    living, to see this Experiment; which he perform’d thus:</p>
                <note n="n113">
                    <p n="1">
                        <hi rend="italics">Conjuring for <sic>stoln</sic> Goods.</hi>
                    </p>
                </note>
                <p n="84">The Conjurer order’d three Fires to be made in a triangular Form, which was
                    accordingly done; then he was hoodwink’d very securely, with a dress’d
                    Deer-Skin, two or three doubles, over his Face. After he had made some Motions,
                    as they always do, he went directly out of one of the three Gaps, as exactly as
                    if he had not been blindfolded, and kept muttering to himself, having a Stick in
                    his Hand, with which, after some time, he struck two Strokes very hard upon the
                    Ground, and made thereon a Cross, after which he told the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi>'s Name that had <sic>stoln</sic> the Goods, and said, that he would have a Cross on his Back; which
                    prov’d true; for when they took and search’d him, there appear’d two great
                    Wheals on his Back, one cross the other; for the Thief was at Governor <hi rend="italics">Southwell</hi>'s House, and was under no Apprehension of
                    being discover’d. The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> proffer’d to fell him as a
                    Slave to the Governor, but he refused to buy him; so they took him bound
                    away.</p>
                <p n="85">Another Instance, of the like Nature, happen’d at the same House. One of the <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro</hi> Kings had brought in a Slave to the same
                    Governor, to whom he had sold him; and before he return’d, fell sick at the
                    Governor’s House; upon which, the Doctor that belong’d to this King’s Nation,
                    was sent for, being a Man that was held to be the greatest Conjurer <pb n="217" xml:id="p217"/> amongst them. It was three Days, before he could arrive, and
                    he appear’d (when he came) to be a very little Man, and so old, that his Hair
                    was as white as ever was seen. When he approach’d the sick King, he order’d a
                    Bowl of Water to be brought him, and three Chunks of Wood, which was immediately
                    done. Then he took the Water, and set it by him, and spurted a little on him,
                    and with the three Pieces of Wood, he made a Place to stand on, whereby he was
                    rais’d higher; (he being a very low statur’d Man) then he took a String of <hi rend="italics">Ronoak,</hi> which is the same as a String of small Beads;
                    this he held by one End, between his Fingers; the other End touch’d the King’s
                    Stomach, as he stood on the Logs. Then he began to talk, and at length, the
                    By-standers thought really, that they heard somebody talk to him, but saw no
                    more than what first came in. At last, this String of Beads, which hung thus
                    perpendicular, turn’d up as an Eel would do, and without any Motion of his, they
                    came all up (in a lump) under his Hand, and hung so for a considerable time, he
                    never closing his Hand, and at length return’d to their pristine Length and
                    Shape, at which the Spectators were much <sic>frightned</sic>. Then he told the Company, that he would recover, and that his
                    Distemper would remove into his Leg, all which happen’d to be exactly as the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Doctor had told. These are Matters of Fact, and I
                    can, at this day, prove the Truth thereof by several substantial Evidences, that
                    are Men of Reputation, there being more than a dozen People present, when this
                    was perform’d; most of whom are now alive.</p>

                <p n="86">There are a great many other Stories, of this Nature, which are seemingly true,
                    being told by Persons that affirm they were Eye-Witnesses thereof; as, that they

                    Mouth, and stand by a Creek-side, where he call’d twice or thrice with the Reed
                    in his Mouth; and, at last, has open’d his Arms, and sled over the Creek, which
                    might be-near a quarter of a Mile wide or more; but I shall urge no Man’s
                    Belief, but tell my own; which is, that I believe the two first Accounts, which
                    were acted at Mr. <hi rend="italics">Southwell</hi>'s Plantation, as firmly as
                    any Man can believe any thing of that which is told him by honest Men, and he
                    has not seen; not at all doubting the Credit of my Authors.</p>

                <p n="87">The Cures I have seen perform’d by the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> are too
                    many to repeat here; so I shall only mention some few, and their Method. They
                    cure Scald-heads infallibly, and never miss. Their chief Remedy as I have seen
                    them make use of, is, the Oil of Acorns, but from which sort of Oak I am not
                    certain. They cure Burns beyond Credit. I have seen a Man burnt in such a
                    manner, (when drunk) by falling into a Fire, that I did not think he could
                    recover; yet they cur’d him in ten Days, so that he went about. I knew another
                    blown up with Powder, that was cured to Admiration. I never saw an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> have an Ulcer, or soul Wound in my Life; neither
                    is there any such thing to be found amongst them. They cure the Pox, by a Berry
                    that salivates, as <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> does; yet they use Sweating
                    and Decoctions very much with it; as they do, almost on every Occasion; and when
                    they are thoroughly heated, they leap into the River. The Pox is frequent in
                    some of these Nations; amongst which I knew one Woman die of it; and they could
                    not, or would not, cure her. Before she died, she was worn away to a Skeleton,
                    yet walk’d up and down to the last. We had a Planter in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> who had got an Ulcer in his Leg, which had troubled him a
                    great many Years; at last, he apply’d himself to one of these <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Conjurers, who was a <hi rend="italics">Pampticough
                        Indian,</hi> and was not to give the Value of fifteen Shillings for the
                    Cure. Now, I am not positive, whether he wash’d the Ulcer with any thing, before
                    he used what I am now going to speak of, which was nothing but the rotten doated
                    Grains of <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Corn, beaten to Powder, and the soft
                    Down growing on a Turkey’s Rump. This dry’d the Ulcer up immediately, and no
                    other Fontanel was made to discharge the Matter, he remaining a healthful Man,
                    till the time he had the Misfortune to be drown’d, which was many Years after.
                    Another Instance (not of my own Knowledge, but I had it confirm’d by several
                    Dwellers in <hi rend="italics">Maryland,</hi> where it was done) was, of an
                    honest Planter that had been possess’d with a strange <sic>Lingring</sic> Distemper, not usual amongst them, under which he emaciated, and grew
                    every Month worse than another, it having held him several Years, in which time
                    he had made Tryal of several Doctors, as they call them, which, I suppose, were
                    Ship-Surgeons. In the beginning of this Distemper, the Patient was very well to
                    pass, and was possess’d of several <pb n="219" xml:id="p219"/> Slaves, which the
                    Doctors purged all away, and the poor Man was so far from mending, that he grew
                    worse and worse every day. But it happen’d, that, one day, as his Wife and he
                    were commiserating his miserable Condition, and that he could not expect to
                    recover, but look’d for Death very speedily, and condoling the Misery he should
                    leave his Wife and Family in, since all his Negro’s were gone. At that time, I
                    say, it happen’d, that an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> was in the same Room,
                    who had frequented the House for many Years, and so was become as one of the
                    Family, and would sometimes be at this Planter’s House, and at other times
                    amongst the <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi></p>

                    him go to bed, saying, it should not be long, before he came again, which the
                    Patient perform’d as he had ordered; and the Potion he had <sic>administred</sic> made him sweat after the most violent manner that could be, whereby he
                    smell’d very offensively both to himself, and <pb n="220" xml:id="p220"/> they
                    that were about him; but in the Evening, towards Night, <hi rend="italics">Jack</hi> came, with a great Rattle-Snake in his Hand alive, which <sic>frightned</sic> the People almost out of their Senses; and he told his Patient, that
                    he must take that to Bed to him; at which the Man was in a great Consternation,
                    and told the <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> he was resolv’d, to let no Snake
                    come into his Bed, for he might as well die of the Distemper he had, as be
                    kill’d with the Bite of that Serpent. To which the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> reply’d, he could not bite him now, nor do him any Harm; for he
                    had taken out his Poison-teeth, and shew’d him, that they were gone. At last,
                    with much Persuasion, he admitted the Snake’s Company, which the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> put about his Middle, and order’d nobody to take
                    him away upon any account, which was strictly observ’d, although the Snake
                    girded him as hard for a great while) as if he had been drawn in by a Belt,
                    which one pull’d at, with all his strength. At last, the Snake’s Twitches grew
                    weaker and weaker, till, by degrees, he felt him not; and opening the Bed, he
                    was found dead, and the Man thought himself better. The <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> came in the Morning, and seeing the Snake dead, told the Man,
                    that his Distemper was dead along with that Snake, which prov’d so as he said;
                    for the Man speedily recover’d his Health, and became perfectly well.</p>

                <p n="89">They cure the Spleen (which they are much addicted to) by burning with a Reed.
                    They lay the Patient on his Back, so put a hollow Cane into the Fire, where they
                    burn the End thereof, till it is very hot, and on Fire at the end. Then they lay
                    a Piece of thin Leather on the Patient’s Belly, between the Pit of the Stomach
                    and the Navel, so press the hot Reed on the Leather, which burns the Patient so
                    that you may ever after see the Impression of the Reed where it was laid on,
                    which Mark never goes off so long as he lives. This is used for the <sic>Belly-Ach</sic> sometimes. They can colour their Hair black, though sometimes it is
                    reddish, which they do with the Seed of a Flower that grows commonly in their
                    Plantations. I believe this would change the reddest Hair into perfect black.
                    They make use of no Minerals in their Physick, and not much of Animals; but
                    chiefly rely on Vegetables. They have several Remedies for the <sic>Tooth-ach</sic>, which often drive away the Pain; but if they fail, they have Recourse
                    to punching out the Tooth, with a small Cane set <pb n="221" xml:id="p221"/>
                    against the same, on a Bit of Leather. Then they strike the Reed, and so drive
                    out the Tooth; and howsoever it may seem to the <hi rend="italics">Europeans,</hi> I prefer it before the common way of drawing Teeth by those
                    Instruments than endanger the Jaw, and a Flux of Blood often follows, which this
                    Method of a Punch never is attended withal; neither is it half the Pain. The
                    Spontaneous Plants of <hi rend="italics">America</hi> the Savages are well
                    acquainted withal; and a Flux of Blood never follows any of their Operations.
                    They are wholly Strangers to Amputation, and for what natural Issues of Blood
                    happen immoderately, they are not to seek for a certain and speedy Cure, Tears, <sic>Rozins</sic>, and Gums, I have not discover’d that they make much use of; And as
                    for Purging and <sic>Emeticks</sic>, so much in fashion with us, they never apply themselves to, unless in
                    drinking vast Quantities of their <hi rend="italics">Yaupon</hi> or Tea, and
                    vomiting it up again, as clear as they drink it. This is a Custom amongst all
                    those that can procure that Plant, in which manner they take it every other
                    Morning, or oftener; by which Method they keep their Stomachs clean, without
                    pricking the Coats, and straining Nature, as every Purge is an Enemy to.
                    Besides, the great <sic>Diuretick</sic> Quality of their Tea carries off a great deal, that perhaps might
                    prejudice their Health, by Agues, and Fevers, which all <sic>watry</sic> Countries are addicted to; for which reason, I believe, it is, that
                    the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are not so much addicted to that Distemper,
                    as we are, they preventing its seizing upon them, by this Plant alone. Moreover,
                    I have remark’d, that it is only those Places bordering on the Ocean and great
                    Rivers, that this Distemper is frequent in, and only on and near the same Places
                    this Evergreen is to be found; and none up towards the Mountains, where these
                    Agues seldom or never appear; Nature having provided suitable Remedies, in all
                    Countries, proper for the Maladies that are common thereto. The Savages of <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> have this Tea in Veneration, above all the
                    Plants they are acquainted withal, and tell you, the Discovery thereof was by an
                    infirm <hi rend="italics">Indian,</hi> that labour’d under the Burden of many
                    rugged Distempers, and could not be cured by all their Doctors; so, one day, he
                    fell asleep, and dreamt, that if he took a Decoction of the Tree that grew at
                    his Head, he would certainly be cured; upon which he awoke, and saw the <hi rend="italics">Yaupon</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Caffena</hi>—Tree, which
                    was not <pb n="222" xml:id="p222"/> there when he fell asleep. He follow’d the
                    Direction of his Dream, and became perfectly well in a short time. Now, I
                    suppose, no Man has so little Sense as to believe this Fable; yet it lets us see
                    what they intend thereby, and that it has, doubtless, work’d Feats enough, to
                    gain it such an Esteem amongst these Savages; who are too well versed in
                    Vegetables, to be brought to a continual use of any one of them, upon a <sic>meer</sic> Conceit or Fancy, without some apparent Benefit they found thereby;
                    especially, when we are sensible, they drink the Juices of Plants, to free
                    Nature of her Burdens, and not out of Foppery and Fashion, as other Nations are
                    oftentimes found to do. Amongst all the Discoveries of <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> by the Missionaries of the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italics">Spaniards,</hi> I wonder none of them was so kind to the
                    World, as to have kept a Catalogue of the Distempers they found the Savages
                    capable of curing, and their Method of Cure; which might have been of some
                    Advantage to our <hi rend="italics">Materia Medica</hi> at home, when deliver’d
                    by Men of Learning, and other Qualifications, as most of them are. Authors
                    generally tell us, that the Savages are well enough acquainted with those Plants
                    which their Climate affords, and that some of them effect great Cures, but by
                    what Means, and in what Form, we are left in the dark. The Bark of the Root of
                    the Sassafras-Tree, I have observ’d, is much used by them. They generally
                    torrefy it in the Embers, so strip off the Bark from the Root, beating it to a
                    Consistence fit to spread, so lay it on the griev’d Part; which both cleanses a
                    fowl Ulcer; and after <sic>Scarrification</sic>, being apply’d to a Contusion, or Swelling, draws forth the Pain, and
                    reduces the Part to its pristine State of Health, as I have often seen effected.
                    Fats and Unguents never appear in their Chirurgery, when the Skin is once broke.
                    The Fats of Animals are used by them, to render their Limbs pliable, and when
                    wearied, to relieve the Joints, and this not often, because they approve of the
                    Sweating-House (in such cases) above all things. The Salts they mix with their
                    Bread and Soupe, to give them a Relish, are <hi rend="italics">Alkalis,</hi>
                    (viz.) Ashes, and calcined Bones of Deer, and other Animals. Sallads, they never
                    eat any; as for Pepper and Mustard, they reckon us little better than Madmen, to
                    make use of it amongst our Victuals. They are never troubled with the Scurvy,
                    Dropsy, nor Stone. The <sic>Phthisick</sic>, Asthma, and <pb n="223" xml:id="p223"/> Diabetes, they are wholly
                    Strangers to; neither do I remember I ever saw one <sic>Paralytick</sic> amongst them. The Gout, I cannot be certain whether they know what it
                    is, or not. Indeed, I never saw any Nodes or Swellings, which attend the Gout in
                        <hi rend="italics">Europe;</hi> yet they have a sort of <sic>Rhumatism</sic> or Burning of the Limbs, which tortures them grievously, at which time
                    their Legs are so hot, that they employ the young People continually to pour
                    Water down them. I never saw but one or two thus afflicted. The Struma is not
                    uncommon amongst these Savages, and another Distemper, which is, in some
                    respects, like the Pox, but is attended with no <hi rend="italics">Gonorrhæa.</hi> This not seldom bereaves them of their Nose. I have seen
                    three or four of them render’d most miserable Spectacles by this Distemper. Yet,
                    when they have been so negligent, as to let it run on so far without curbing of
                    it; at last, they make shift to patch themselves up, and live for many years
                    after; and such Men commonly turn Doctors. I have known two or three of these
                    no-nose Doctors in great Esteem amongst these Savages. The Juice of the
                    Tulip-Tree is used as a proper Remedy for this Distemper. What Knowledge they
                    have in Anatomy, I cannot tell, neither did I ever see them employ themselves
                    therein, unless, as I told you before, when they make the Skeletons of their
                    Kings and great Mens Bones.</p>

                <p n="90">The <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are very careless and negligent of their
                    Health; as, by Drunkenness, Wading in the Water, irregular Diet and Lodging, and
                    a thousand other Disorders, (that would kill an <hi rend="italics">European</hi>) which they daily use. They boil and roast their Meat
                    extraordinary much, and eat abundance of Broth, except the Savages whom we call
                    the naked <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> who never eat any Soupe. They travel
                    from the Banks of the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Messiasippi</sic>,</hi> to war against the <hi rend="italics">Sinnagars</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Iroquois,</hi> and are (if equal Numbers) commonly too hard
                    for them. They will lie and sleep in the Woods without Fire, being inur’d
                    thereto. They are the hardiest of all <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and run
                    so fast, that they are never taken, neither do any <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> outrun them, if they are pursu’d. Their Savage Enemies say,
                    their Nimbleness and Wind proceeds from their never eating any Broth. The
                    Small-Pox has been fatal to them; they do not often escape, when they are seiz’d
                    with that Distemper, which is a contrary Fever to what they ever knew. <pb n="224" xml:id="p224"/> Most certain, it had never visited <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> before the Discovery thereof by the Christians.
                    Their running into the Water, in the Extremity of this Disease, strikes it in,
                    and kills all that use it. Now they are become a little wiser; but formerly it
                    destroy’d whole Towns, without leaving one <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> alive
                    in the Village. The Plague was never known amongst them, that I could learn by
                    what Enquiry I have made: These Savages use <sic>Scarrification</sic> almost in all Distempers. Their chief Instruments for that Operation
                    is the Teeth of Rattle-Snakes, which they poison withal. They take them out of
                    the Snake’s Head, and suck out the Poison with their Months, (and so keep them
                    for use) and spit out the Venom, which is green, and are never damag’d thereby.
                    The Small-Pox and Rum have made such a Destruction amongst them, that, on good
                    grounds, I do believe, there is not the sixth Savage living within two hundred
                    Miles of all our Settlements, as there were fifty Years ago. These poor
                    Creatures have so many Enemies to destroy them, that it’s a wonder one of them
                    is lest alive near us. The Small-pox I have acquainted you withal above, and so
                    I have of Rum, and shall only add, that they have got a way to carry it back to
                    the Westward <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> who never knew what it was, till
                    within very few Years. Now they have it brought them by the <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro’s,</hi> and other Neighbour-<hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> but
                    the <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro’s</hi> chiefly, who carry it in Rundlets
                    several hundred Miles, amongst other <hi rend="italics">Indians.</hi> Sometimes
                    they cannot forbear breaking their Cargo, but sit down in the Woods, and drink
                    it all up, and then hollow and shout like so many <hi rend="italics">Bed-Lamites.</hi> I accidentally once met with one of these drunken Crews,
                    and was amaz’d to see a Parcel of drunken Savages so far from any <hi rend="italics">Englishman</hi>'s House; but the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> I had in Company inform’d me, that they were Merchants, and
                    had drunk all their Stock, as is very common for them to do. But when they
                    happen to carry it safe, (which is seldom, without drinking some part of it, and
                    filling it up with Water) and come to an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Town,
                    those that buy Rum of them have so many Mouthfuls for a Buck-Skin, they never
                    using any other Measure; and for this purpose, the Buyer always makes Choice of
                    his Man, which is one that has the greatest Mouth, whom he brings to the Market
                    with a Bowl to put it in. The Seller looks narrowly to the Man’s Mouth <pb n="225" xml:id="p225"/> that measures it, and is he happens to swallow any
                    down, either through Wilfulness or otherwise, the Merchant or some of his Party,
                    does not scruple to knock the Fellow down, exclaiming against him for false
                    Measure. Thereupon, the Buyer finds another Mouthpiece to measure the Rum by; so
                    that this Trading is very agreeable to the Spectators, to see such a deal of
                    Quarrelling and Controversy, as often happens, about it, and is very
                    diverting.</p>

                    poisoning one another; which is done by a large, white, <sic>spungy</sic> Root, that grows in the Fresh-Marshes, which is one of their Poisons;
                    not but that they have many other Drugs, which they poison one another

                <p n="92">Lastly, the continual Wars these Savages maintain, one Nation against another,
                    which sometimes hold for some Ages, killing and making Captives, till they
                    become so weak thereby, that they are forced to make Peace for want of Recruits,
                    to supply their Wars; and the Difference of Languages, that is sound amongst
                    these Heathens, seems altogether strange. For it often appears, that every dozen
                    Miles, you meet with an <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Town, that is quite
                    different from the others you last parted withal; and what a little supplies
                    this Defect is, that the most powerful Nation of these Savages scorns to treat
                    or trade with any others (of sewer Numbers and less Power) in any other Tongue
                    but their own which serves for the <hi rend="italics">Lingua</hi> of the
                    Country, with which we travel and deal; as for Example, we see that the <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro’s</hi> are most numerous in <hi rend="italics">North-Carolina,</hi> therefore their Tongue is understood by some in every
                    Town of all the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> near us. And here I shall insert
                    a small dictionary of every Tongue, though not Alphabetically digested.</p>

                <p n="95">To repeat more of this <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Jargon, would be to trouble
                    the Reader; and as an Account how imperfect they are in their Moods and Tenses,
                    has been given by several already, I shall only add, that their Languages or
                    Tongues are so deficient, that you cannot suppose the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> ever could express themselves in such a Flight of Stile, as
                    Authors would have you believe. They are so far from it, that they are but just
                    able to make one another understand readily what they talk about. As for the two
                    Consonants <hi rend="italics">L</hi> and <hi rend="italics">F,</hi> I never knew
                    them in any <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Speech I have met withal; yet I must
                    tell you, that they have such a Way of abbreviating their Speech, when in their
                    great Councils and Debates, that the young Men do not understand what they treat
                    about, when they hear them argue. It is wonderful, what has occasion’d so many
                    different Speeches as the Savages have. The three Nations I now mention’d, do
                    not live above ten Leagues distant, and two of them, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Tuskeruro’s</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Woccon,</hi> are not two Leagues asunder; yet their Speech
                    differs in every Word thereof, except one, which is <hi rend="italics">Tsaure,
                        Cockles,</hi> which is in both Tongues the same, and nothing else. Now this
                    Difference of Speech causes Jealousies and Fears amongst them, which bring Wars,
                    wherein they destroy one another; otherwise the Christians had not (in all
                    Probability) settled <hi rend="italics">America</hi> so easily, at they have
                    done, had these Tribes of Savages united themselves into one People or general
                    Interest, or were they so but every hundred Miles. In short, they are an odd
                    sort of People under the Circumstances they are at present, and have some such
                    uncouth Ways in their Management and Course of Living, that it seems a Miracle
                    to us, how they bring about their Designs, as they do, when their Ways are
                    commonly quite contrary to ours. I believe, they are (as to this Life) a very
                    happy People; and were it not for the Feuds amongst themselves, they would enjoy
                    the happiest State (in this World) of all Mankind. They met with Enemies when we
                    came amongst them; for they are no nearer Christianity now, than they were at
                    the first Discovery, to all Appearance. They have <sic>learnt</sic> several Vices of the <hi rend="italics">Europeans,</hi> but not one
                    Vertue, as I know of. Drunkenness was a Stranger, when we found them out, and
                    Swearing their Speech cannot express; yet those that speak <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> learn to swear the first thing they <pb n="232" xml:id="p232"/> talk of. It’s true, they have some Vertues and some Vices; but how the
                    Christians can bring these People into the Bosom of the Church, is a Proposal
                    that ought to be form’d and follow’d by the wisest Heads and best Christians.
                    After I have given one Remark or two farther, of some of their strange Practices
                    and Notions, I will give my Opinion, how I think, in probability, it may be (if
                    possible) effected, and so shall conclude this Treatise of <hi rend="italics">Carolina.</hi></p>
                <p n="96">They are a very craving People, and if a Man give them any thing of a Present,
                    they think it obliges him to give them another; and so on, till he has given
                    them all he has; for they have no Bounds of Satisfaction in that way; and if
                    they give you any thing, it is to receive twice the Value of it. They have no
                    Consideration that you will want what you give them; for their way of Living is
                    so contrary to ours, that neither we nor they can fathom one <sic>anothers</sic> Designs and Methods. They call Rum and Physick by one Name, which
                    implies that Rum make People sick, as when they have taken any poisonous Plant;
                    yet they cannot for bear Rum. They make Offerings of their First-Fruits, and the
                    more serious sort of them throw into the Ashes, near the Fire, the first Bit or
                    Spoonful of every Meal they sit down to, which, they say, is the same to them,
                    as the pulling off our Hats, and talking, when we go to Victuals, is to us. They
                    name the Months very agreeably, as one is the Herring-Month, another the
                    Strawberry-Month, another the Mulberry-Month, Others name them by the Trees That
                    blossoms; especially, the Dogwood-Tree; or they say, we will return when
                    Tur-Key-Cocks gobble, that is in <hi rend="italics">March</hi> and <hi rend="italics">April.</hi> The Age of the Moon they understand, but know no
                    different Name for Sun and Moon. They can guess well at the time of the Day, by
                    the Sun’s Height. Their Age they number by Winters, and say, such a Man or Woman
                    is so many Winters old. They have no Sabbath, or Day of Rest. Their Slaves are
                    not over-burden’d with Work, and so not driven by Severity to seek for that
                    Relief. Those that are acquainted with the <hi rend="italics">English,</hi> and
                    speak the Tongue, know when <hi rend="italics">Sunday</hi> comes; besides, the
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> have a distinct Name for <hi rend="italics">Christmas</hi> which they call <hi rend="italics">Winnick Keshuse,</hi> or
                    the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Englishmans</sic>
                        <sic>Gods</sic> Moon.</hi> There is one most abominable Custom amongst them, which
                    they call <hi rend="italics">Husquenawing</hi> their young Men; which I have not
                        <pb n="233" xml:id="p233"/> made any Mention of as yet, so will give you an
                    Account of it here. You must know, that most commonly, once a Year, or, at
                    farthest, once in two Years, these People take up so many of their young Men, as
                    they think are able to undergo it, and <hi rend="italics">husquenaugh</hi> them,
                    which is to make them obedient and respective to their Superiors, and (as they
                    say) is the same to them, as it is to us to send our Children to School, to be
                    taught good Breeding and Letters. This House of Correction is a large strong
                    Cabin, made on purpose for the Reception of the young Men and Boys, that have
                    not passed this Graduation already; and it is always at <hi rend="italics">Christmas</hi> that they <hi rend="italics">husquenaugh</hi> their Youth,
                    which is by bringing them into this House, and keeping them dark all the time,
                    where they more than half-starve them. Besides, they give them Pellitory-Bark,
                    and several intoxicating Plants, that make them go raving mad as ever were any
                    People in the World; and you may hear them make the most dismal and hellish
                    Cries, and Howlings, that ever humane Creatures express’d; all which continues
                    about five or six Weeks, and the little Meat they eat, is the nastiest,
                    loathsome stuff, and <sic>mixt</sic> with all manner of Filth it’s possible to get. After the Time is
                    expired, they are brought out of the Cabin, which never is in the Town, but
                    always a distance off, and guarded by a <sic>Jaylor</sic> or two, who watch by Turns. Now, when they first come out, they are as
                    poor as ever any Creatures were; for you must know several die under this
                    diabolical Purgation. Moreover, they either really are, or pretend to be dumb,
                    and do not speak for several Days; I think, twenty or thirty; and look so <sic>gastly</sic>, and are so chang’d, that it’s next to an Impossibility to know them
                    again, although you was never so well acquainted with them before. I would fain
                    have gone into the mad House, and have seen them in their time of Purgatory, but
                    the King would not suffer it, because, he told me, they would do me, or any
                    other white Man, an Injury, that ventured in amongst them; so I desisted. They
                    play this Prank with Girls as well as Boys, and I believe it a miserable Life
                    they endure, because I have known several of them run away, at that time, to
                    avoid it. Now, the Savages say, if it was not for this, they could never keep
                    their Youth in Subjection, besides that it hardens them ever after to the
                    Fatigues of War, Hunting, and all manner of Hardship, <pb n="234" xml:id="p234"/> which their way of living exposes them to. Besides, they add, that it carries
                    off those infirm <sic>weakBodies</sic>, that would have been only a Burden and Disgrace to their Nation, and
                    saves the Victuals and Cloathing for better People, that would have been
                    expended on such useless Creatures. These Savages are described in their proper
                    Colours, but by a very few; for those that generally write Histories of this new
                    World, are such as Interest, Preferment, and Merchandize, drew thither, and know
                    no more of that People than I do of the <hi rend="italics">Laplanders,</hi>
                    which is only by Hear-say. And if we will make just Remarks, how near such
                    Relations generally approach Truth and Nicety, we shall find very few of them
                    worthy of Entertainment; and as for the other part of the Volume, it is
                    generally <sic>stufft</sic> with Invectives against the Government they lived under, on which
                    Stage is commonly acted greater Barbarities, in Murdering worthy Mens
                    Reputations, than all the Savages in the new World are capable of equalizing, or
                    so much as imitating.</p>
                <p n="97">And since I hinted at a Regulation of the Savages, and to propose a way to
                    convert them to Christianity, I will first particularize the several Nations of
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> that are our Neighbours, and then proceed to
                    what I promis’d.</p>

                    contain, in all, about 750 Men, Women and Children. Total 4780.</p>
                <pb n="235" xml:id="p235"/>
                <p n="99">Now, there appears to be one thousand six hundred and twelve Fighting Men, of our
                    Neighbouring <hi rend="italics">Indians;</hi> and probably, there are three
                    Fifths of Women and Children, not including Old Men, which amounts to four
                    thousand and thirty Savages, besides the five Nations lately come. Now, as I
                    before hinted, we will see what grounds there are to make these People
                    serviceable to us, and better themselves thereby.</p>
                <p n="100">On a fair Scheme, we must first allow these Savages what really belongs to them,
                    that is, what good Qualities, and natural Endowments, they possess, whereby they
                    being in their proper Colours, the Event may be better guess’d at, and
                    fathom’d.</p>
                <p n="101">First, they are as apt to learn any Handicraft, as any People that the World
                    affords; I will except none; as is seen by their Canoes and <sic>Stauking</sic> Heads, which they make of themselves; but to my purpose, the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Slaves in South <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi>
                    and elsewhere, make my Argument good.</p>
                <p n="102">Secondly, we have no disciplin’d Men in <hi rend="italics">Europe,</hi> but what
                    have, at one time or other, been branded with <sic>Mutining</sic>, and Murmuring against their Chiefs. These Savages are never found
                    guilty of that great Crime in a Soldier; I challenge all Mankind to tell me of
                    one Instance of it; besides, they never prove Traitors to their Native Country,
                    but rather <sic>chuse</sic> Death than partake and side with the Enemy.</p>
                <p n="103">They naturally possess the Righteous Man’s Gift; they are Patient under all
                    Afflictions, and have a great many other Natural Vertues, which I have slightly
                    touch’d throughout the Account of these Savages.</p>
                <p n="104">They are really better to us, than we are to them; they always give us Victuals
                    at their Quarters, and take care we are arm’d against Hunger and Thirst: We do
                    not so by them (generally speaking) but let them walk by our Doors Hungry, and
                    do not often relieve them. We look upon them with Scorn and Disdain, and think
                    them little better than Beasts in Humane Shape, though if well examined, we
                    shall find that, for all our Religion and Education, we possess more Moral
                    Deformities, and Evils than these Savages do, or are acquainted withal.</p>
                <p n="105">We reckon them Slaves in Comparison to us, and Intruders, as oft as they enter
                    our Houses, or hunt near our <pb n="236" xml:id="p236"/> Dwellings. But if we
                    will admit Reason to be our Guide, she will inform us, that these <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are the freest People in the World, and so far
                    from being Intruders upon us, that we have abandon’d our own Native Soil, to
                    drive them out, and possess theirs; neither have we any true Balance, in Judging
                    of these poor Heathens, because we neither give Allowance for their Natural
                    Disposition, nor the <sic>Sylvian</sic> Education, and strange Customs, (uncouth to us) they lie under and
                    have ever been train’d up to; these are false Measures for Christians to take,
                    and indeed no Man can be reckon’d a Moralist only, who will not make choice and
                    use, of better Rules to walk and act by: We trade with them, it’s true, but to
                    what End? Not to <sic>shew</sic> them the Steps of Vertue, and the Golden Rule, to do as we would be
                    done by. No, we have furnished them with the Vice of Drunkenness, which is the
                    open Road to all others, and daily cheat them in every thing we fell, and esteem
                    it a Gift of Christianity, not to fell to them so cheap as we do to the
                    Christians, as we call our selves. Pray let me know where is there to be found
                    one Sacred Command or Precept of our Master, that counsels us to such Behaviour?
                    Besides, I believe it will not appear, but that all the Wars, which we have had
                    with the Savages, were occason’d by the unjust Dealings of the Christians
                    towards them. I can name more than a few, which my own Enquiry has given me a
                    right Understanding of, and I am afraid the remainder (if they come to the test)
                    will prove themselves Birds of the same Feather.</p>

                </note>
                <p n="106">As we are in Christian Duty bound, so we must act and behave ourselves to these
                    Savages, if we either intend to be serviceable in converting them to the
                    Knowledge of the Gospel, or discharge the Duty which every Man, within the Pale
                    of the Christian Church, is bound to do. Upon this Score, we ought to <sic>shew</sic> a Tenderness for these Heathens under the weight of Infidelity; let us
                    cherish their good Deeds, and, with Mildness and Clemency, make them sensible
                    and <sic>forwarn</sic> them of their ill ones; let our Dealings be just to them in every
                    Respect, and <sic>shew</sic> no ill Example, whereby they may think we advise them to practise that
                    which we will not be conformable to ourselves: Let them have cheap Penniworths
                    (without Guile in our Trading with them) and learn them the Mysteries of our
                    Handicrafts, as well as our <pb n="237" xml:id="p237"/> Religion, otherwise we
                    deal unjustly by them. But it is highly necessary to be brought in Practice,
                    which is, to give Encouragement to the ordinary People, and those of a lower
                    Rank, that they might marry with these <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> and come
                    into Plantations, and Houses, where so many Acres of Land and some Gratuity of
                    Money, (out of a Publick Stock) are given to the new-married Couple; and that
                    the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> might have Encouragement to send their
                    Children Apprentices to proper Masters, that would be kind to them, and make
                    them Masters of a Trade, whereby they would be drawn to live amongst us, and
                    become Members of the same Ecclesiastical and Civil Government we are under;
                    then we should have great Advantages to make daily Conversions amongst them,
                    when they saw that we were kind and just to them in all our Dealings. Moreover,
                    by the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> Marrying with the Christians, and coming
                    into Plantations with their <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Husbands, or Wives,
                    they would become Christians, and their Idolatry would be quite forgotten, and,
                    in all probability, a better Worship come in its Stead; for were the <hi rend="italics">Jews</hi> engrafted thus, and alienated from the Worship and
                    Conversation of <hi rend="italics">Jews,</hi> their Abominations would vanish,
                    and be no more.</p>
                <p n="107">Thus we should be let into a better Understanding of the <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Tongue, by our new Converts; and the whole Body of these People
                    would arrive to the Knowledge of our Religion and Customs, and become as one
                    People with us. By this Method also, we should have a true Knowledge of all the
                        <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> Skill in Medicine and Surgery; they would
                    inform us of the Situation of our Rivers, Lakes, and Tracts of Land in the Lords
                    Dominions, where by their Assistance, greater Discoveries may be made than has
                    been hitherto found out, and by their Accompanying us in our Expeditions, we
                    might civilize a great many other Nations of the Savages, and daily add to our
                    Strength in Trade, and Interest; so that we might be sufficiently enabled to
                    conquer, or maintain our Ground, against all the Enemies to the Crown of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> in <hi rend="italics">America,</hi> both
                    Christian and Savage.</p>
                <p n="108">What Children we have of theirs, to learn Trades, &amp;c. ought to be put into
                    those Hands that are Men of the best Lives and Characters, and that are not only
                    strict Observers of their Religion, but also of a mild, winning and sweet
                    Disposition, that these <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Parents may often go and
                    see how <pb n="238" xml:id="p238"/> well their Children are dealt with, which
                    would much win them to our Ways of Living, Mildness being a Vertue the <hi rend="italics">Indians</hi> are in love withal, for they do not practise
                    beating and correcting their Children, as we do. A general Complaint is, that it
                    seems impossible to convert these People to Christianity, as, at first fight, it
                    does; and as for those in <hi rend="italics">New Spain,</hi> they have the
                    Prayer of that Church in Latin by Rote, and know the external Behaviour at Mass
                    and Sermons; yet scarce any of them are steady and abide with constancy in good
                    Works, and the Duties of the Christian Church. We find that the <hi rend="italics">Fuentes</hi> and several other of the noted <hi rend="italics">Indian</hi> Families about <hi rend="italics">Mexico,</hi>
                    and in other parts of <hi rend="italics">New Spain,</hi> had given several large
                    Gifts to the Altar, and outwardly seem’d fond of their new Religion; yet those
                    that were the greatest Zealots outwards, on a strict Enquiry, were found guilty
                    of Idolatry and Witchcraft; and this seems to proceed from their Cohabiting,
                    which, as I have noted before, gives Opportunities of Cabals to <sic>recal</sic> their ancient pristine Infidelity and Superstitions. They never argue
                    against our Religion, but with all imaginable Indifference own, that it is most
                    proper for us that have been brought up in it.</p>
                <p n="109">In my opinion, it’s better for Christians of a mean Fortune to marry with the
                    Civiliz’d <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> than to suffer the Hardships of four
                    or five years Servitude, in which they meet with Sickness and Seasonings amidst
                    a Crowd of other Afflictions, which the Tyranny of a bad Master lays upon such
                    poor Souls, all which those acquainted with our Tobacco Plantations are not
                    Strangers to.</p>
                <p n="110">This seems to be a more reasonable Method of converting the <hi rend="italics">Indians,</hi> than to set up our Christian Banner in a Field of Blood, as
                    the <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> have done in <hi rend="italics">New
                        Spain,</hi> and baptize one hundred with the Sword for one at the Font.
                    Whilst we make way for a Christian Colony through a Field of Blood, and defraud,
                    and make away with those that one day may be wanted in this World, and in the
                    next appear against us, we make way for a more potent Christian Enemy to invade
                    us hereafter, of which we may repent, when too late.</p>

                    CAROLINA.</head>
                <p n="1">As to the Government of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> the Laws of <hi rend="italics">England</hi> are there in Force; yet the Lords-Proprietors,
                    by their Deputies, have Power, with the Consent of the Inhabitants, to make
                    By-Laws for the better Government of the said Province; so that no Law can be
                    made, or Money rais’d, unless the Inhabitants, or their Representatives, consent
                    thereto: One Law which they have in South-<hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi>
                    deserves particular Mention, which is, their Method of <sic>chusing</sic> Juries, it being done by making a considerable Number of
                    Paper-Billets, on which are written the Names of as many of the most substantial
                    Freeholders. These Billets are put into a Hat, out of which Twenty-four are
                    chosen by the next Child that appears. Then, out of those Twenty-four, Twelve
                    are chosen at the next Court, after the same manner; which is an infallible way
                    to prevent all Manner of Fraud.</p>
                <pb n="256" xml:id="p256"/>
                <p n="2">North and South-<hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi> Settlements are distant from one
                    another some hundreds of Miles; so that Necessity compels each Colony to keep to
                    themselves, a Governour, Council and Assembly. The Governor represents the
                    Lord-Palatine; the rest of the Counsellors are the Lord-Deputies; who, of
                    themselves, make a Palatines Court, and a Court of Chancery; wherein they pass
                    several Orders of Council, much of the Nature of the Prince’s Proclamation;
                    which continues no longer in Force, than the next Assembly. Likewise, they grant
                    several sorts of Commissions, Warrants, <hi rend="italics">&amp;c.</hi> yet
                    Military Commissions lie wholly in the Governor’s Power; but Making of War or
                    Peace, in all, or the Majority of the Lords-Deputies; by whom (the Governor
                    being one) it is determin’d, and by whose Commissions all other Magistrates act.
                    On these Heads they have settled, and maintain an admirable Constitution of
                    Government, for the lasting Peace, Security, and Well-being of all the
                    Inhabitants. The way of any ones taking up his Land in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> due to him either by Purchasing it of the Lords Proprietors
                    here in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> who keep their Board at <hi rend="italics">Craven-House</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Drury-Lane,
                        London,</hi> the first <hi rend="italics">Thursday</hi> in every Month; or
                    if purchas’d in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> is after this manner: He first
                    looks out for a Place to his Mind, that is not already possess’d by any other;
                    then applies himself to the Governor and Lords Proprietors Deputies, and <sic>shews</sic> what Right he hath to such a Tract of Land, either by Purchase of the
                    Lords in <hi rend="italics">England,</hi> or by an Entry in the
                    Surveyor-General’s Office, in order to purchase of the Governor and Lords
                    Deputies there in <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> who thereupon issue out
                    their Warrant-Land as is due to him. Who making Certificate, that he had
                    measured out so much Land and the Bounds, a Deed is prepared of Course, by the
                    Secretary, which is sign’d by the Governor and the Lords Proprietors Deputies,
                    and the Proprietors Seal affix’d to it, and register’d in the Secretaries
                    Office, which is a good <sic>Coveyance</sic> in Law of the Land therein mention’d, to the Party and his Heirs for
                    ever.</p>
                <p n="3">Thus have I given you as large and exact an Account of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> as the Discovery of so few Years (in this great <pb n="257" xml:id="p257"/> and extensive Land) would permit. Which flourishing Country
                    will, doubtless, in time, increase the Number of its Productions, and afford us
                    plentifully those Necessaries and rich Commodities, which the <hi rend="italics">Streights, <sic>Turky</sic></hi> and other Countries supply us withal at present, and not
                    seldom in their own Shipping; whereas, were those Merchandizes the Produce of an
                        <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Plantation, and brought us home by our own
                    Hands and Bottoms, of what Advantage such an Improvement would be to the Crown
                    of <hi rend="italics">Great-Britain,</hi> and the People in general, I leave to
                    Men of Reason and Experience to judge. I do intend (if God permit) by future
                    Voyages (after my Arrival in <hi rend="italics">Carolina</hi>) to pierce into
                    the Body of the Continent, and what Discoveries and Observations I shall, at any
                    time hereafter, make, will be communicated to my Correspondents in <hi rend="italics">England</hi> to be publish’d, having furnish’d myself with
                    Instruments and other Necessaries for such Voyages.</p>
                <p n="4">For the better Understanding of this Country, I have already drawn a very large
                    and exact Map thereof, as far as any Discoveries have been yet made, either by
                    others or my self, and have spared neither Cost nor Pains, to procure the most
                    correct Maps and Journals thereof, that are extant in Print, or in Manuscript.
                    This Map containing nine Sheets of Imperial Paper, and now sit for engraving,
                    begins at Cape <hi rend="italics">Henry</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Virginia,</hi> 37 deg. N. Lat. and contains all the Coasts of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Florida,</hi> with the
                        <hi rend="italics">Bahama</hi> Islands, great Part of the Bay of <hi rend="italics">Mexico,</hi> and the Island of <hi rend="italics">Cuba,</hi>
                    to the Southward, and several Degrees to the Westward of of the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Messiasippi</sic></hi> River, with all the Indian Nations and Villages, and their
                    Numbers, which of them are subject to <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> and
                    trade with their People, what Places are convenient Factories and Forts, to
                    increase and secure our Trade on the <hi rend="italics"><sic>Messiasippi</sic>,</hi> and what Forts and Factories the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Spaniards</hi> have gain’d in those
                    Latitudes, especially on the great River and the Neighbouring Streams; all which
                    they illegally possess, since the very Mouth of the River <hi rend="italics"><sic>Messiasippi</sic></hi> is in the King of <hi rend="italics">England’s</hi> Grant to
                    the Lords Proprietors of <hi rend="italics">Carolina,</hi> it falling something
                    to the <pb n="258" xml:id="p258"/> Northward of 29 Degr. <hi rend="italics">North</hi> Lat. whose Claim and Right I question not, but a Peace will
                    adjust, and restore, which every <hi rend="italics">Englishman</hi> is bound in
                    Duty and Interest, to wish for; if we consider how advantageously they have
                    seated themselves, whereby to disturb the Peace and Interest of all the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Plantations on the Continent of <hi rend="italics">America.</hi></p>
