Lord’s Label


This is a kind of Ground Moss: Or at least, it grows among it. It is green, I think, all the year: Or if die any time of year, it is at Midsummer. It was Gathered Dec. 12, 1707. It grows in wet mossy ground. Job. Lord.
Lonchitis; or, rough spleenwort. This seems to be one sort of it. It grows in our swamps & low ground: is green here all winter, as well as summer. I have seen some of the leaves near two foot in length, & with such specks of dust as Ceterach has; but it is rare to find that.

A sort of Fern, that is green with us all the year. If I mistake not, it was the root of this with which an Indian trader told me that he cured himself of the Lame distemper (as it is here called): But what is, it is hard to know. For some call Lues Venerea so; others call another Distemper which is more than ordinary Malignant Scurvey. Job. Lord.
Asplenium, or Ceterach. Smooth Spleen-wort. This Grew out of the sides of a well; but it grows also in our swamp & wet grounds, upon logs that are covered with Moss & rotten, & also upon Hassocks that are mossy; But seldom so large as these leaves are. It is to be found green most part of the year. Gathered, Dec. 12, 1707.

I take this to be the first Gentian of Culpper's Description in his English Physician. It has it's flowers usually at the top of the Stalks sometimes 6 to 7 together; but some creature had bit off the top of this; which occasioned that flower to grow as you see. It is found beginning to blossom at the middle of October, & continues in flower, til the frost kills the leaves & stalk which was not this year till the middle of December. This gathered, Nov. 8, 1707./The Root of that Gentian, the Stalk & flower whereof is in the Box. Gathered Dec. 12, 1707

This grows in low & wet ground by brooks. It is in flower late in October. The leaves grow two & two, not usually making a cross as in this, yet one Couple standing frost to the next from bottom to top.









This is the same plant I formerly sent the root whereof an Indian commended against the biting of the rattle-snake; but then it was not in the seed, as now, Sept. 27, 1704.
The root of this grass tastes somewhat like Pellitory of Spain, but I think a little more subtile, hot, & Pierceing. Being used as a Masticatory it draws Rheum out of the Head, & so cures the Tooth-ach, if it come of a watery or Phlegmatick Humor. I have infused it in Purges for the Dropsy & find it Powerfully to Provoke Urine. Gathered Sept. 19, 1704. The place of its growth, is among little bunches of bushes that grow in the moist parts of our Savanna & sometimes is found growing among other grass, tho there be no bushes.
This rushy plant, with a triangular stalk had no companion of it's own kind, for which cause you have but one stalk. Gathered Aug. 15, 1704. In wet, low, ground.
This grows in Savannas & such like moist grassy places. Gathered, June 5 1704.
This was gathered, June 5th, in a moist, but not fenny Savanna Ground.
This is very common in our low, wet, & grassy Lands, Gathered, Aug. 15, 1704. It is near about a month since I saw some of it in flower.
This grows in high & dry ground. Gathered about the middle of July. The flower is of a brownish color, very small, & appearing out of little husks as if it were seed.
This Rushy Grass, or Grassy Rush, grows in wet Ground. Gathered near the beginning of May 1704. It seems to be too short for your Randalia Mariana. There is another Rush with somewhat a larger white head, which I intend before long to get Specimens of.
I suppose this may be your Randalia Mariana Procerior. It grows in Savannas & such like moist grassy places, gathered, Jun. 5, 1704.

this I supposed to be a Ragweed, till I took notice of your two ???cea's of Carolina (932, 933); which if they be the plants that I guess them to be, seem to be of the same tribe with this. It's flower is yellow somewhat smaller than those of the ordinary Sow-thistle, of the same color & shape. There issues out of it a yellowish milk there were some flowers full blown when I gathered it, Sept. 7, 1704, in high dry Land.
This seems to be an Hieracium. Gathered (one plant) about the first or 2nd day of Aug. 1704 in weedy ground near the edge of a Savanna; which is the place it mostly grows in. Another (if it be not a differing sort) which has the knobbed Root & no such bunch of leaves near the root, gathered, Sept. 12. 
This Plant has a milky juice. Gathered Sept. 12 1704 in low & dry land.
Mousear. It grows in moist grassy ground most usually; but is also found in woods, that are dryer. Gathered about the middle of May 1704.
I am at a loss to what tribe to refer this Plant. It has narrow grass-like leaves, a yellow flower; one was full blown when I gathered it, which is now turned into a downy Head, round after the manner of Dandelion & Hawkweed; it will, I suppose, be lost before it gets to you. Gathered, about May 6, 1704, in a piece of Ground that was newly cleared. I have seen it since by the High way side, but it is not common.
This I sent you in the Last Box, & now send it again to show you that it is yet in Blossom, the whole plant & root is full of milk. Gathered Jun. 15, 1704. The leaves of this are narrower than that I sent before.
This also grows in high dry land. Gathered abt beginning of October, 1704.
This plant bears a reddish purple flower, which was blown when I gathered it, abt the beginning of October 1704. Grows in high, dry land.
The flower of this was much of the same color (vix, par???), but differing in figure consisting of a yellow head set above a pole of such colored leaves as the other. Grows in high land. Gathered abt the beginning of October, 1704.
These two small-flowered wild daisies (as I take them to be) I put together, as being gathered both in a Day; Viz, May 4th, 1703, in my Plantation by my house, which is an high light land. They are still in flower, May 23. The blew-flowered one is not so common as the other. / This is a troublesome weed in our Plantations & Pastures. It's flower resembles that which we call Groundsel, [several words crossed out] which I intend to get & send when it flowers (which will be, now, quickly); which it also resembles in smell. Gathered July 14, 1704.


This is of the Tribe, doubtless, of that which I have sent in this present box, of whose vertue against the biting of the rattle-snake I have made mention. Gathered, Sept. 19, in low, but dry, land.
This (I think) I have sent you formerly without a name, as now it comes: but I desire you would please to let me know it's name. Besides that an Indian told me of it's use in feavers, its found to be Alexipharmacal, & an admirable antidote against the Poison of Rattle-snakes in particular, conquering the Venom of their biteing. Gathered, Aug. 15, 1704, having been near a month in flower. It grows common in our woods, both in high & low land. There are divers other plants growing commonly that seem to be varieties of this.
??? grows commonly in wet grassy land. Gathered, Sept. 29.
This grows commonly in Land somewhat moist as well as drier, Gathered Sept. 6, 1704.
This was gathered Aug. 4, 1704, in high land among bushes etc.
If this plant do not continue all the winter green, it shoots up leaves early in the Spring & a while after begins to shoot up a stalk. The first leaves are larger than any of these. The root (I think) continues many years. It flowers not till the summer is almost gone. The head out of which the flowers do shoot appears near a month before they bloom. You have many head not yet blown on this plant. Gathered Sept. 7, 1704, in high dry land, & grows both in wooddy ground and that which is cleared.
This grows for the most part, in wet grassy ground. Gathered Sept. 12 or 13, 1704.
This Plant began to flower about a fortnight or three weeks ago. It grows in wet waterish places. It is now generally seeding. I may put in a specimen or two in the seed. June 15, 1704.
The leaves of this are smooth, of a pale green colour, at the bottom, as large as Bay leaves, but toward the top, the leaves are smaller with some harmless prickles on them. The Heads, you may see, are like thistles; & so are the flowers somewhat like them, of a pale blew & some almost white. They grow in low ground by swampsides etc. Gathered June 14.
This was gathered Aug. 4, 1704. In high dry land; which is the land it usually grows in, under the sides of fences(?) & in such like places.
This grows in such like ground as the former, gathered same time, Sept. 6.
This grows plentifully in many places, but most usually in high dry land. Gathered June 15, 1704.
This sometimes grows six, seven, even eight feet high; gathered, Sept. 6, 1704, in a part of my plantation. It grows ordinarily about 4 or 5 feet high; it is commonly found in land meanly fruitfull, as well as that which is more fruitfull, both higher and lower. A Chirugeon shewed it me by the name of wood-gold, or wood-marigold; but others call it All-heal.
This I gathered in my Pasture, in a good soil, Sept. 6, 1704, in land of a mean driness.
This is common in wet land. Gathered Sept. 29, 1704. If I mistake it not it is a plant that springs out of the ground on single leap like Adders-tongue, but only without a tongue, & as large as one of them that is next to the root in this.
This plant is plentiful in most sorts of ground. Gathered June 15, 1704.
This plant is remarkable in its stalk & leaves. It grows pretty frequently in lanes somewhat low by fence sides & among bushes. Gathered Aug. 4, 1704. Its height was near six feet; but commonly it is 4 or 5.
This is our Countrey Agrimony, whose root has many clogs hanging from it by Strings; in which I suppose it to differ from that in Europe; for that I never read of any such clogs in any description thereof that I have met with. Gathered, Sept. 6, 1704, in a good soil. / This goes for Agrimony, & I can find no reason to question it only that Authors make no mention of those ??? at it's roots which that has. It was gathered in the beginning of April 1705, & grows in good soils, where the earth is light. If you think it not to be Agrimony send word what it is, if you please.
This Plant seems to be a Sideritis, or Iron-wort. It grows in grassy land, where the soil is good, & usually in places somewhat moist. Gathered, July 13, 1704, when some plants of it had been in flower near a month.
This I take to be Thalictrum or Bastard Rhubarb. It grows generally in a fertile low land. Gathered May 3, 1704.
Prunella. It grows with us in moist woods. Gathered, about May 19, 1704.
This Plant grows plentifully near to my House, in a good soil; not over dry, nor yet wet. Gathered about the beginning of May 1704.
This is what we call Wild Hyssop, but smells much like Calamint, which it resembles both[?] in flowers & seed. I send it now, Sept. 29, to shew it is not yet [???]
This is commonly called wild Hysop. I know not whether it is ??? Hysop or no. It has somewhat of the smell of Hysop. Grows commonly in low moist grassy ground. Gathered, Jun 13, 1704.
I am ready to conceive this to be a Bugle. It grows in good soils near to moist places, or in moist ground most usually. Gathered June 3 1704. There is another plant that has just the same flowers which is now (Jun. 15) generally gone to seed, & differs only in that it has a short, rough leaf.
This climbing plant I found by the highway side, among an Heap of dry brush, near to a brookside, about 2 miles from my house, about the beginning of May (I think the 5th), 1704.

This grows in low but dry land. It's leaves have a white milky juice in them. Gathered Sept. 12, 1704. The flower is a deeper blew, but of the same shape with that gathered Sept. 9.
A plant, whose flower & height much resembled this, I think I sent you in the last Box; but differing from this, in that it had more leaves & flowers upon the stalk; the flowers were of a deeper color, & the leaves of the flowers less pointed than those of this. Also that had branches full of leaves, which spread on the ground at the bottom of that stalk on which the flowers grew, which leaves of the branches stood by fours so as to make a cross at each joint; none of which is in this. The Stalk also of this is finer & weaker than that. This grows in many places where that did; but chiefly seems to delight in ground that is somewhat moist, & grows only among Grass & weeds. Gathered July 14, 1704.
This bears a blew flower or two, in one of those umbles which you see at the joints, which in shape somewhat resembles those of the bindweed. Gathered Sept. 7, 1704, in a piece of ground somewhat moist & fat, near a brook.
This I gathered about a week ago, in a low ground, in which sort of ground it usually grows. June 15, 1704. It differs in stature according to the ground it grows in. The flower is of a pale purple color.
This seems a sort of Madder, or Woodroof, or such like herb, grows commonly in Plantations. Gathered about the middle of October, 1704.
This plant grows in moist, watery places that are also grassy. Gathered Sept. 23, 1704. It's flower is red inclining to purple.
This plant grows plentifully in some high land. It is of a pleasant smell, somewhat like Calamint. It has been in flower about a month, Sept. 26, 1704. It's flower consists of four lovely blew leaves standing up, & one hanging down, which is near as long again as the rest & flew at the outer end, but nearer to the flower of a greenish white speckled with purple. It has also two long blew chives stand up, as it were to avoid nearness to said hanging long leaf, but bending inward at the top.
This is our ordinary scabious. It is now ready to die away, having generally produced it's seed, Jun 15. It grows in our Plantations plentifully.
This plant grows in abundance in our Plantations about April or May, if they be not plowed before; It's flower is blew. At the bottom, & before the stalk whereon the flower grows runs up, it spreads upon the Ground, having, as you may see, 4 small leaves, like thyme, standing about a branch after the manner of cross-wort. This is the plant which I mention that I thought I had sent before.
This Scabius with a white flower, I have yet met with nowhere but in a piece of ground belonging to myself, which is a piece of upland between two brooks. Gathered, Sept. 7, 1704.
The Branches of this plant lean toward the ground, & so spread, yet raise themselves a little. The flowers are yellow of the shape of Pease flowers. Gathered, June 15, 1704. It is still to be found in flower July 28.
This grows in high light land; bears a red flower, after which comes a bud. Gathered Jun 15, 1704.
This has some resemblance of Sena, both in leaves & flowers, & is common in high & low land that is not wet, growing by fence sides and in places that are overrun with brush & weeds.  Gathered Aug. 3, 1704. It grows sometimes about 3 or 4 foot high; but commonly it's branches lean toward the Earth & spread 3 or 4 feet broad. It's Root & part of the stalk is put in with it.
This plant grows in woody low ground, that is moist & grassy. It was gathered June 2d, 1704.
This plant is common in high light ground. After the flower come forth short cods, about an inch long containing seed like pulse. It's root consist of fibres swelling out in many places into rough clogs, as big as a goose quill, or bigger, somewhat flat, with the hogs root much after. It was gathered June 2. It was then beginning to flower.
These three leaved pants, have small flowers, of a pale purplish color, inclining to red, some more blew; all of the shape of pease flowers, small considering the bigness of the plant. Grow chiefly in dry cleared ground. gathered Sept. 7, 1704 (two sorts). The several sorts are distinguished by their leaves.

This is commonly called wild Mary-gold among ???. It grows in wett swampy Grounds & other moist grassy places. Gathered Jun. 3, 1704.
This I have sent you already, of else it is long since put into this present box; but I now send it again, to shew you it is to be found still in flower. July 14, 1704. Be pleased to let me know what is the name of it.
This has been in flower near a month; some I found in the flower this day, Jun. 15, 1704. It grows in low ground usually where it is grassy. Gathered Jun. 2.
This grows commonly about in high ground. It was gathered in May, & is yet in flower. June 15, 1704.
This plant, when I gathered it, with some more specimens of the same (which were eaten by some worm or other insect & so spoiled) about the middle of April; had a great white flower on it (the faded leaves whereof you may see) standing on the top of the stalk, & 2 or 3 narrow grasslike leaves, somewhat thick, of a dark green color, smooth & shineing. They grow in wet low ground, in wet places on our Savannas, & in swamps sometimes; are in flower the most part of April.
This plant spreads on the ground, only it has a stalk rising from among the leaves which bears divers yellow blossoms after which succeed short cods, when they are ripe black with a blewish dust on them, which have seed in them that rattle. Gathered in the beginning of June, or end of May, 1704. Are in seed now, Jun. 15.
This red flowered small Centaury grows in our plantations, after they are laid down. This was gathered, Aug. 18, 1704, but this was the only stalk I then found., it haveing been pretty generally in flower a month befor. There are also with us commonly a white flowered, & yellow-flowered Centaury, which I doubt it is too late to look for this year.
This yellow Ornithogalum or Starflower, I found in they pine woods, about the beginning of August, 1704. but could find no more but this one plant.

??? has square stalks like Centaury the left, & the leaves are much like it, but small & growing thick upon it. Its flowers are yellow or near to orange color, roundish leaves & some chives in the middle. Gathered ?? 31, 1704. In near grassy ground.
This grows in low, but dry fertile lands. Gathered May 13, 1704.
This is that which the Children commonly call Sugar-grass, others Deers-grass; & is accounted a sort of Tea. It differs from all the others, in that this has an hoary & smooth leaf, the others a rough, hairy, & not so green a leaf. A little Difference also there is in the taste, there being some acidness in the taste of the others, mixed with a sweet, which is little or nothing perceived in this. The flowers of this are the same with the others; differing from the white flowered, only in color & greatness; & from the short rough-leaves, in that the flowers of that are a little pointed at the outer end of their leaf, of this & the rest not so. Gathered, July 31, 1704. It grows both in Pine-land & Savanna's. 
This grows plentifully in many places where the land is low & moist. Gathered, Jun. 14, 1704. Is now flowering July 26. / This I suppose to be your Linulum Carolinianum Humistratum. Gathered Sept. 7, 1704. In high ground; though I observe it most plentiful in such places as water stands in after a rain, if there be a black soil for it to grow in. I observed it in flower at least a month ago.


This bears a yellow flower somewhat like Scabious; the leaf also well resembles the same plant, some sort of it. Grows in low moist grass[?]; gathered, Oct. 4, 1704.
This differs from the red flowered rough Tea in nothing, but only the flower of this is white, & the plant it's self is more branched. Gathered July 24, 1704, in a moist Savanna. It had flowers which fell off with the Gathering. / These specimens whew the white-flowered Deers-grass not to be all so branched as the other that I gathered lately. This I gathered July 31. Yet ordinarily this sort is more branched than this.
This is the same growth & taste with that sort of plant which the Children hereabouts call Sugar-grass, others Deers-grass, & I think to be a species of Tea. It has also the same sort of flower (which is red, consisting of 4 leaves) & seed vessel. Gathered, July 21, 1704. There is another sort with shorter leaves, but is in other respects like this.
This is the small leaved Sugar-grass, or Deer's-grass. Gathered, abt the beginning of Aug. or end of July 1704 in moist land.
This seems to be a sort of Sway-blade. It grows only in or near to fenny & wet grounds. Gathered about the 5th or 6th of May, 1704, when there were but few plants in flower. They are flowering near all the month.
This plant seems to be of the kindred of that which Gerard (???member?) calls Phalangium Virginianum Ephe???, having such a flower, such stalks & leaves, little heads by the flowers, as if more flowers were come???; but it wants the two leaves which that other hath, manner of Cyress grass; the flowers are smaller, & blew, & fades not so soon. It grows in low, but wooddy ground. Gathered Jun. 13, 1704. About a month ?? weeks before I saw three Plants of the above Phalangium, & not knowing how soon they would fade ??? gather them then; but the next day went to look for them, but could find but one; & in that, the flower of the day before was full blown) together with the heads (I ??? about a Douzen) were sunk in between those two â€¦ that I could discern, but a little of any of them. This was in flower when I gathered it but the flowers are withered.
This is a differing species of the plant which Gerard calls Hollow-Sea-Lavender (or at least Johnson upon Gerard) & Limonio Congener. That which he there describes has a flower upon a Stalk by it's self; but I could never observe any that this has. It flourishes all the Summer; Springing up in April or May.
This Satyrion's flower is white. Gathered Aug. 10, 1704, in one of those that we call wet Savannas. These specimens seem to be different sorts by the roots, which are different both in shape & the manner of growth.
This Orchis has a flower of an Orange coulor (as it were) a little faded. Gathered Aug. 10, 1704. In Savanna ground.
This is a low sort of Periclymenum rectum, with white flowers. Gathered about the middle of May 1704. Here are two other sorts which are past before this shews it's self. One has a pale flower, like a Damask rose in color; the other a flower almost as red as a red rose. Both grow also higher than this, which seldom grows above 2 or 3 foot high; & all by brooksides or other watery places. If you have met with the Temperature & use of these, please to communicate them.
This plant grows in moist fertile ground that has a deep loose (or light) soil. It has three leaves at the top of the stalk, amidst which stands upright one dark reddish purple flower, when it is full; but greenish before it is full blown. You may see the flower in it's perfection in one of the samples, & the shape & manner of standing of the leaves, in the other. Gathered May 3d, 1704. Those spots in the leaves that now (dried) look most green, when they are fresh look of the color of the liver of a beast, before it be sodden[?], as it is when taken out of the beast.
These are twigs of the maple, with blossoms of a dark red color. Gathered Mar. 17, 1704, at which time most of the trees had dropt their Blossoms; but I met with two, one whereof was full out in blossom the other not fully blown; & accordingly you have smaller on one & full blossoms on the other twig.
The end of a branch, & the fruit of the shrub which we commonly call Fishpoison, because the root put into the bottom of a basket & the basket much moved to and again in a small pond of standing water, makes all the fish (or the most) in such a Pond to turn up their bellies and so rise to the top of the water as if they were dead, when yet they are taken & eaten without harm. Gathered, Sept. 29, 1704. And grows in our Pastures to our great detriment.
This Plant grows not to any great bigness. I have not seen any that grew above three foot high. And indeed it is but lately that I have taken any notice of it & that I have at all was occasioned by an Indian who commends it for the Head-ack in such as have Agues. When it is green the leaf smells much like Potatoes beginning to rot. Gathered about the middle of Sept., 1704.
Grows in ground somewhat moist, & usually in a good soil. The flowers bell-fashioned of a pale color inclineing to purple & hanging downward. Gathered, May 19, 1704.
