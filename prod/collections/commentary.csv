There doesn’t seem to be any solid evidence or discussion on the topic of this plant having any ability to cure any sort of infectious disease or much else in direction of medicinal properties.

Gentians are mountainous plants, which are used to produce tonic when extracted from the roots. Today _Gentiana saponaria_ is still used as a tonic, but is also used for a number of other things including liver complaints, indigestion, gastric infections, and anorexia (pfaf). There is little research on the medicinal effects of this species of the _Gentiana_ genus, and I found nothing about this plant related to the treatment of syphilis.

He also says that when he combines laxatives ('purges') with this plant to treat tissue swelling ('dropsy'), it is a powerful diuretic ('provokes urine'). While Lord claims this plant was also useful in removing excess water in the body, it seems today that this plant’s most effective medical use is as a mild numbing agent for the mouth, and hence the common name, toothache grass (roundstoneseed; treasure coast native; Gamboa-Leon R, Chilton WS 2000. 'Isobutylamide numbing agents of toothache grass, *ctenium aromaticum*.' *Biochem Syst Ecol* 28(10):1019. Today the common name is toothache grass because it numbs the mouth when chewed."

Spach","urn:cite:botcar:commentary.4","urn:cite:botcar:lordSpecimens.46","Lord says it has 'virtue against the biting of the rattle-snake'. This plant contains a chemical that is toxic to cattle and can cause 'milk sickness' in humans ingesting the milk of cattle eating this plant. In the Midwest, this killed many settlers and was responsible for the death of Abraham Lincoln’s mother. Clewell AF and Wooten JW. 1971. 'A revision of *ageratina* (*compositae: Eupatorieae*) from eastern north america.' *Brittonia* 23(2):123-43. For humans, however, this plant is said to be an antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic, and expectorant, but there is no substantial research to prove these are valid uses (practicalplants). The plant is antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic and expectorant. It is used in the treatment of inflammation and irritability of the bladder, ague, pulmonary diseases, stomach complaints and nervous diseases.

Rhubarbs were known to possess a number of medicinal uses including those as an astringent, tonic, stomachic (digestion stimulant), and aperient (mild purgative). This plant is, however, a *Thalictrum* species, sometimes referred to as 'Poor Man’s Rhubarb' in Europe for having similar effects as Rhubarb at higher doses. None of the American species of *Thalictrum* have been analyzed for these types of effects. While no medicinal effects have been studied for this particular species of *Thalictrum*, *Thalictrum minus* has been found to have many components of antioxidants (Karyagina, Bairamashvili, Gukasova 2011). Alkaloids of various species of *Thalictrum* have been extracted, exemplifying significant antibacterial properties, which researchers say deem the plant acceptable for use in treating microbrial infections (as it’s used in Kenya) (Mayeku PW et al. 2013). Research on species of the Thalictrum genus is continuously growing, making *Thalictrum macrostylum* an interesting species for further research.

This plant is said to act as an analgesic (pain reliever), diaphoretic (perspiration stimulant), febrifuge (fever reducer), and a stomachic (digestion stimulant) although none of these claims are backed up by research (pfaf).

Hyaluronic acid has both medical advantages and disadvantages including anti-aging effects and enabling metastasis of tumors, making the ability to inhibit hyaluronidase of interest.
