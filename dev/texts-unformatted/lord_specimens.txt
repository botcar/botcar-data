<div n="158"><p n="5">This is a kind of Ground Moss: Or at least, it grows among it. It is green, I think, all the year: Or if die any time of year, it is at Midsummer. It was Gathered Dec. 12, 1707. It grows in wet mossy ground. Job. Lord.</p></div>
<div n="158"><p n="16">Lonchitis; or, rough spleenwort. This seems to be one sort of it. It grows in our swamps &amp; low ground: is green here all winter, as well as summer. I have seen some of the leaves near two foot in length, &amp; with such specks of dust as Ceterach has; but it is rare to find that.</p></div>
<div n="158"><p n="16"></p></div>
<div n="158"><p n="17">A sort of Fern, that is green with us all the year. If I mistake not, it was the root of this with which an Indian trader told me that he cured himself of the Lame distemper (as it is here called): But what is, it is hard to know. For some call Lues Venerea so; others call another Distemper which is more than ordinary Malignant Scurvey. Job. Lord.</p></div>
<div n="158"><p n="18">Asplenium, or Ceterach. Smooth Spleen-wort. This Grew out of the sides of a well; but it grows also in our swamp &amp; wet grounds, upon logs that are covered with Moss &amp; rotten, &amp; also upon Hassocks that are mossy; But seldom so large as these leaves are. It is to be found green most part of the year. Gathered, Dec. 12, 1707.</p></div>

<div n="158"><p n="213">I take this to be the first Gentian of Culpper's Description in his English Physician. It has it's flowers usually at the top of the Stalks sometimes 6 to 7 together; but some creature had bit off the top of this; which occasioned that flower to grow as you see. It is found beginning to blossom at the middle of October, &amp; continues in flower, til the frost kills the leaves &amp; stalk which was not this year till the middle of December. This gathered, Nov. 8, 1707./The Root of that Gentian, the Stalk &amp; flower whereof is in the Box. Gathered Dec. 12, 1707</p></div>

<div n="268"><p n="1">The root of this grass tastes somewhat like Pellitory of Spain, but I think a little more subtile, hot, &amp; Pierceing. Being used as a Masticatory it draws Rheum out of the Head, &amp; so cures the Tooth-ach, if it come of a watery or Phlegmatick Humor. I have infused it in Purges for the Dropsy &amp; find it Powerfully to Provoke Urine. Gathered Sept. 19, 1704.

<div n="268"><p n="19">I am at a loss to what tribe to refer this Plant. It has narrow grass-like leaves, a yellow flower; one was full blown when I gathered it, which is now turned into a downy Head, round after the manner of Dandelion &amp; Hawkweed; it will, I suppose, be lost before it gets to you.

Gathered, Aug. 15, 1704, having been near a month in flower. It grows common in our woods, both in high &amp; low land.

<div n="268"><p n="41">If this plant do not continue all the winter green, it shoots up leaves early in the Spring &amp; a while after begins to shoot up a stalk. The first leaves are larger than any of these. The root (I think) continues many years. It flowers not till the summer is almost gone. The head out of which the flowers do shoot appears near a month before they bloom. You have many head not yet blown on this plant. Gathered Sept. 7, 1704, in high dry land, &amp; grows both in wooddy ground and that which is cleared.</p></div>

<div n="268"><p n="63">This is our Countrey Agrimony, whose root has many clogs hanging from it by Strings; in which I suppose it to differ from that in Europe; for that I never read of any such clogs in any description thereof that I have met with. Gathered, Sept. 6, 1704, in a good soil. / This goes for Agrimony, &amp; I can find no reason to question it only that Authors make no mention of those ??? at it's roots which that has. It was gathered in the beginning of April 1705, &amp; grows in good soils, where the earth is light. If you think it not to be Agrimony send word what it is, if you please.</p></div>
<div n="268"><p n="65">This Plant seems to be a Sideritis, or Iron-wort. It grows in grassy land, where the soil is good, &amp; usually in places somewhat moist. Gathered, July 13, 1704, when some plants of it had been in flower near a month.</p></div>

<div n="268"><p n="75">I am ready to conceive this to be a Bugle. It grows in good soils near to moist places, or in moist ground most usually. Gathered June 3 1704. There is another plant that has just the same flowers which is now (Jun. 15) generally gone to seed, &amp; differs only in that it has a short, rough leaf.</p></div>

<div n="284"><p n="42">A plant, whose flower &amp; height much resembled this, I think I sent you in the last Box; but differing from this, in that it had more leaves &amp; flowers upon the stalk; the flowers were of a deeper color, &amp; the leaves of the flowers less pointed than those of this. Also that had branches full of leaves, which spread on the ground at the bottom of that stalk on which the flowers grew, which leaves of the branches stood by fours so as to make a cross at each joint; none of which is in this. The Stalk also of this is finer &amp; weaker than that. This grows in many places where that did; but chiefly seems to delight in ground that is somewhat moist, &amp; grows only among Grass &amp; weeds. Gathered July 14, 1704.</p></div>

It's flower consists of four lovely blew leaves standing up, &amp; one hanging down, which is near as long again as the rest &amp; flew at the outer end, but nearer to the flower of a greenish white speckled with purple. It has also two long blew chives stand up, as it were to avoid nearness to said hanging long leaf, but bending inward at the top.</p></div>
<div n="284"><p n="53">This is our ordinary scabious. It is now ready to die away, having generally produced it's seed, Jun 15. It grows in our Plantations plentifully.</p></div>

At the bottom, &amp; before the stalk whereon the flower grows runs up, it spreads upon the Ground, having, as you may see, 4 small leaves, like thyme, standing about a branch after the manner of cross-wort. This is the plant which I mention that I thought I had sent before.</p></div>

<div n="284"><p n="79">This is that which the Children commonly call Sugar-grass, others Deers-grass; &amp; is accounted a sort of Tea.

A little Difference also there is in the taste, there being some acidness in the taste of the others, mixed with a sweet, which is little or nothing perceived in this. The flowers of this are the same with the others; differing from the white flowered, only in color &amp; greatness; &amp; from the short rough-leaves, in that the flowers of that are a little pointed at the outer end of their leaf, of this &amp; the rest not so.

It had flowers which fell off with the Gathering. / These specimens whew the white-flowered Deers-grass not to be all so branched as the other that I gathered lately. This I gathered July 31.

<div n="284"><p n="89">This is the same growth &amp; taste with that sort of plant which the Children hereabouts call Sugar-grass, others Deers-grass, &amp; I think to be a species of Tea. It has also the same sort of flower (which is red, consisting of 4 leaves) &amp; seed vessel. Gathered, July 21, 1704. There is another sort with shorter leaves, but is in other respects like this.</p></div>

<div n="285"><p n="1">This Satyrion's flower is white. Gathered Aug. 10, 1704, in one of those that we call wet Savannas. These specimens seem to be different sorts by the roots, which are different both in shape &amp; the manner of growth.</p></div>
<div n="285"><p n="1">This Orchis has a flower of an Orange coulor (as it were) a little faded. Gathered Aug. 10, 1704. In Savanna ground.</p></div>
<div n="285"><p n="4">This is a low sort of Periclymenum rectum, with white flowers. Gathered about the middle of May 1704. Here are two other sorts which are past before this shews it's self. One has a pale flower, like a Damask rose in color; the other a flower almost as red as a red rose. Both grow also higher than this, which seldom grows above 2 or 3 foot high; &amp; all by brooksides or other watery places. If you have met with the Temperature &amp; use of these, please to communicate them.</p></div>
<div n="285"><p n="4">This plant grows in moist fertile ground that has a deep loose (or light) soil. It has three leaves at the top of the stalk, amidst which stands upright one dark reddish purple flower, when it is full; but greenish before it is full blown. You may see the flower in it's perfection in one of the samples, &amp; the shape &amp; manner of standing of the leaves, in the other. Gathered May 3d, 1704. Those spots in the leaves that now (dried) look most green, when they are fresh look of the color of the liver of a beast, before it be sodden[?], as it is when taken out of the beast.</p></div>
<div n="285"><p n="5">These are twigs of the maple, with blossoms of a dark red color. Gathered Mar. 17, 1704, at which time most of the trees had dropt their Blossoms; but I met with two, one whereof was full out in blossom the other not fully blown; &amp; accordingly you have smaller on one &amp; full blossoms on the other twig.</p></div>
<div n="285"><p n="5">The end of a branch, &amp; the fruit of the shrub which we commonly call Fishpoison, because the root put into the bottom of a basket &amp; the basket much moved to and again in a small pond of standing water, makes all the fish (or the most) in such a Pond to turn up their bellies and so rise to the top of the water as if they were dead, when yet they are taken &amp; eaten without harm. Gathered, Sept. 29, 1704. And grows in our Pastures to our great detriment.</p></div>
<div n="285"><p n="8">This Plant grows not to any great bigness. I have not seen any that grew above three foot high. And indeed it is but lately that I have taken any notice of it &amp; that I have at all was occasioned by an Indian who commends it for the Head-ack in such as have Agues. When it is green the leaf smells much like Potatoes beginning to rot. Gathered about the middle of Sept., 1704.</p></div>
<div n="285"><p n="75">Grows in ground somewhat moist, &amp; usually in a good soil. The flowers bell-fashioned of a pale color inclineing to purple &amp; hanging downward. Gathered, May 19, 1704.</p></div>
