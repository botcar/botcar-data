EARLY LETTERS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA UPON NATURAL HISTORY

The letters printed below are from the Sloane Manuscripts, in the British Museum. 
There is some doubt as to whom they were written; Prof. Charles M. Andrews, in 
the _Guide to Manuscript Materials for the History of the United Slates to 1783_,  
pp. 51, 69, lists them as letters to Sir Hans Sloane; but Mr. J. A. Herbert, 
assistant keeper of Mss., British Museum, writes that the Sloane Mss. contains 
besides the letters to Sir Hans Sloane, "some to Dr. Browne and Mr. Petiver;" 
The letters of Hannah Williams and Joseph Lord, have been indexed in _Index 
to the Sloane_ Mss., E. J. L. Scott, as letters to James Petiver. 
An account of Petiver can be found in the _Dictionary of National Biography_. 

Hannah Williams who writes the first letter given here, was in South Carolina 
before 1692, for as Hannah English widow, she gets a warrant, dated October 25, 
1692, for 500 acres of land near Stony Point[^1] and in May, 1695, she had 
another warrant under the name of "Hannah English, alias Williams." She may 
have been the widow of Mathew English, who arrived here in February 1670, 
and had a warrant for a town lot as late as 1689.[^2] She was certainly 
the mother of Henroyda English,[^3] and married William Williams between 
1692 and 1694. Williams arrived with his wife and child 24 December, 1683. 
He made his will 2d November, 1710, proved 26th October, 1711, as 
William Williams of Carolina planter, and gives to his son-in-law Henroyda 
English, all of his estate, real and personal. Hannah Williams, 
widow to William Williams, declares the above will to have been made with 
her consent. [^4]

The will of Charles Clarke, of Berkley County, dated November 2, 1694, 
mentions Mrs. Mary Spragg, daughter of Mrs. Hannah Williams, to whom 
he leaves a house and lot, bounding on late belonging to Gov. Thomas Smith. 
Mentions also William Williams, gentleman, of Carolina, and leaves 
the remainder of his property to William Williams and Mrs. Mary Spragg.[^5]

Mrs. Hannah Williams was buried December 16, 1722.[^6] 

Joseph Lord, who writes the other letters, was the pastor under whom the 
settlers from Dorchester Mass. immigrated to the place in South Carolina, 
which they afterwards named Dorchester also. "ocktober the 20-95 was mr. 
Joseph Lord and Increase Sumner and William pratt were dismissed for the 
gathering of A church for the South corelina.”[^7] 

Joseph Lord was of Charlestown, Mass. He had graduated at Harvard in the 
class of 1691, and at the time of his removal to Carolina, was teaching 
school, and studying theology in Dorchester. He remained in South Carolina 
for twenty-five years, returning to Massachusetts in 1720, and on the 
15th of June of that year was installed over the church at Chatham, 
where he remained until his death, June 6th. 1748.[^8] 

His  sister, Abigail, married John Stevens, who was one of the 
leading men in the Dorchester settlement, and the ancestor of the 
present Stevens family in lower South Carolina. John Stevens 
probably came from New England also, since in his will, dated 
December 24, 1717, he directs that his sons Samuel and John 
"be brought up at the college in New England to good lerning… 
and my brother Will Titcomb have care of them… ;" he also 
leaves a legacy to Joseph Lord Jr., upon con­
dition that he also be sent to college.

Abigail Stevens, in her will dated 30th March, 1735, mentions, 
among others, her nephew Joseph Lord, son of her brother Rev. 
Joseph Lord in New England.

Next Spring I will send you some Mocking birds  &  Red birds if I should

[In a different hand and possibly the same hand and ink as the date of the 
letter's receipt at the head:

"Mr. Leigh Husband in Aldermanbury" 

There is no address on the back of the 
letter, but Andrews & Davenport say it is to "Sloane," Dr. Scott, Late Head 
of the MSS. Dept. of the British Museum, said it was to "James Pettiver" to 
whom the next letter in the MS. Sloane, 4064 is addressed, and at the bottom 
of the letter itself though not in Hannah Williams' hand, is "Mr. Leigh Husband."]


LETTER PROM JOSEPH LORD

5. Sir

Since that we came by Pensylvania, Dated, Nov. 17, 1706. I have recd no Lettr 
from you. I sent a Lettr 
& a Box of Collections by Capt. Gill Belcher, the last year 
(the Lettr. dated, Jan. 2, 1707/8, wc I hope are 
come to hand. In yor last the I recd., you mention a Bill of a Bird wc
was sent either by Madm Williams or me, concerning wc I have since 
written you word, tht . I did not remembr tht I sent you any such: 
but I call to mind tht I sent you the Bill of a Garr-fish, wc has sharp teeth 
set all along both sides: of wc I have also one now ready to send you, 
as I have also Divers othr things wc I have collected. Anothr sort of Tortoise, 
tht that wc you sent me the figure of marked 76.4. I have the shell of, 
wc I intend to send you e'er long. Here are divers sorts of thm ., tho' I don't 
often meet wth thm . The shell 71.8 & 71.9 is, I suppose, tht wc the wood-snail 
carries on his back, & houses himself in. I have sent divers of thm , if I forget 
not, but perhaps they might be broken before they came at you, for 
I find thm very brittle. The Centipes, 74.3 is very like a worm 
wth us, wc wn it dies, gathers almost into a circle as yor figure represents: 
but wn the worm is liveing, as it crawls, that side wre the feet are seems flat. 
You figure a  Cowry,  80.9. wc I don't know wt distinguishes 
from othr shells: but yor figure puts me in mind of a sort of Insect 
here, tht is covered wth hair, between chestnut & ash colour; the 
belly wre of is flat, & the two sides run up to a ridge, wre is longr 
hair thn on the rest of the body, & carries some resemblance of hog's 
bristles. The insect is abt an inch long, & abt. half an inch broad 
at the belly; & abt. as deep from the ridge to the belly. The year 
before last came a neighbor to me in great pain, & heart-sick, by 
being bitten by one of thm in the neck; & would (for ought I know) 
have died, if suitable remedies both inward & outward, had not 
been applied. I had observed the insect before, & would have 
sent it to you, if I had known how. Yor desire thereof prevailed
wth me to make some remarks, in my last, on yor Natural History 
of Brasile; wc (tho' I know my unskilfulness) I shall now proceed, 
as  well  as I can, a little farthr in Ch. 2. 87. The Partridge] That 
wc is here called a Partridge, we called a Quail in N. Engld., wc 
seems to be of the color spoken of in this place: but we had a Par-
tridge in  N.  Engld. speckled wth white specks (if I forget not) 
wc was twice as big as this here in Carolina. 88. The Great Par-
tridge]  There was, in  N.  Engld. another Fowl tht resembled the 
Partridge, but larger (yet not so large as this great Partridge is 
Described) wc was called an Heath-hen. 93. American Sparrow] 
I suppose or Red-bird to be a Sparrow; wc is the same wth the Vir-
ginia Red-bird; & threfore I need not describe it. Also wn I was a 
boy I caught another sort of red Sparrow; but have forgot wherein 
it differed from other sparrows, except in being Red. They were 
rare there. I have some notion tht . I then reckoned it of the 
same species wth that wth. a red head: divers whereof had reddish 
Breasts too: whether it were those tht . were oldr yn others, I can-
not tell. 94.  The Black Sparrow]  we had in  N.  Engld. a sparrow 
wth. a red spot on the head; but the body was of a greyish brown 
color. There is also a Sparrow here tht . is like that of N. England; 
only the spot on the head is not so red. I have heard them in N. 
Engld. called Tom Tits. 95.  Tkc  Blewish  Sparrow]  We have 
here a Sparrow tht is between blew & ash-color, whose bill is white, 
& his belly & the outermost feathr on each side of his tail. 96-101. 
Divers  Starlings  are mentioned, & described. We have here two 
or three sorts of Back birds wc flock togethr :ye male of one sort 
has a scarlet spot on each wing;  &  the female is a dark grey almost 
black. 103. The Swallow] The male, here, is shineing black on 
his back, head, &  breast; the female more muddy, & on the breast 
of a yellowish brown  color.  108.  The Throstle]  That wc was called, 
in N. Engld., a Robin (but at Dorchestr in New England, a Field-
fare) I have heard a Lancashire man call a Throstle: It comes 
hither in the Wintr, but is not seen here in the summr. 110.111. 
We have a  Turtle dove here, but whethr the leggs be red or white 
or eithr I can't now say; but I think thy  are red. The New-England 
wild Pidgeon, is also a large sort of Turtle, wth red leggs: they 
come hithr sometimes in the Wintr. 114-116. Woodpeckrs] 
We have three or four sorts; some as large as Teal. Thus I end 
ye 2d Chaptr of Birds, I cannot now proceed to any othr: only
Ch. 9. 158.  Thc Dysenterick Vomit] concerning this I wd enquire, 
is it not Ipecacuaha tht . you here intend? If it be, please to let 
me know whethr you have had any of it from hence, &  at what 
it's flowrs & berries may likliest be sought. I put a small plant 
in the Lettr, wc in the Wintr had 5 or 6 Leaves together at the top: 
please to let me know, by the next opportunity, what is. Which 
is all, at present, from
Sir,
Yor humble servant

LETTER PROD JOSEPH LORD

"Worthy Sir,
Yo~ of Mar. 15, 17zs I received Jun. 30: wrapped up in a Monthly Mercury for January last, w'". some oth' Prints, w' is the erst News book or Pap' I ev' received, of all the ev' you sent. You write you are glad to understand I received the things ye. you sent last year, & I sh~ have been glad I c~ have given you to understand the you were rightly informed; for I much regret the loss of the box h w' was in it. But not going to Charlestown myself, I wrote to desire my friend, M' Samuel Evdeigh, to enquire of him ab' it; who sent me word ye. Capt. Bdch' s~ there was indeed such a Box, but he had delivered it to some body, he c~ not tell who; so I nev' saw it. I thought (as I had written to you) ye. he w~. have been more carefull than so. I received, indeed, the lett' ye. gave an account of it, gr w' was enclosed therein:  8r delivered to M'. Henchman's widow, the lett' directed to him, but what you sent to him being put into my box, she came short as well as I. I don't know weth' yo' directing to me near stony point (from w' my habitation is 14 or 15 miles distant)mayn't be some disadvantage to me. M' Henchman (as Capt. Belch' informed you) died suddenly of an Apoplexy last Novemb' was twelve month. I have spoken w'" his wife ab' what he left in writeing, wo I had looked ov' while he was alive; h she promises to lend y me to take copies of, w'. I think to do, R send to you, when I can 6nd opportunity: but multiplicity of business hind~

much ye. I w~ of this nature. Before the comeing of yo' form' by Capt. Belch', w' I rec~. not till Jun. 16, 1709. tho' it were dated Nov. 30, 1708. I wrote a lett' to you, wherein I proceeded w'". my observations (such as they were) on yo' Natural History of Brasile, as far as the end of the second chapt' w' speaks of Birds: wherein also I informed you, ye. I sent no bill of a bird, yet I had sent the bill of a Garr-fish, w', perhaps, you might take for the bill of a fowl; w' I mention here, because yo~ mentions nothing of that lett', w' makes me suspect it's miscarriage. I have a small Box of Collections ready, & sh have had more, but partly the inconvenience of doing it w'"out collecting-books, partly my much oth' necessary business, & partly the confusions & distractions of the countrey, especially at this time, w 4, tho' I would, I cannot altogeth' avoid all concern in, have been an hindrance to me; & w' all being at a great distance from Charlestown, I find great difficulty in getting thith' what I have to send, & many times lose the opportunity of the Ship, before I can obtain a conveyance from hence to Charlstown. In that Box I have put such anoth' bill, besides many oth' things, w' I cannot now particularly enumerate. I w~ have sent the box now, but I have no opportunity to send it to Charlstown. I w~. also have proceeded ' farth' in my observations upon yo' Natural History of Brasile, but time & oth' occasions, will not give leave. With thanks for w~ you have sent, both w' I have received, & w' I have not, I take the boldness to request you, if you can obtain the seed of Sena of Alexandria, the you will please to send me a little. I have Italian Sena growing; but whether it be the it contains more lixivious salt than the oth', or the ye Air of the countrey is more moist y~ of oth' countrys w" Oriental Sena is kept or first dried, I cannot, w'" all the care I can use, prevent it's turning black in a little time. Here is a sort of bindweed w' I am apt to conceit may be Scammony; w' I believe I may formerly have sent you the branches of. If I sh~. send you that, or any oth' usefull drugg, if you will please to let me know it, you will much oblige, Sir,
Yo' humble Serv'.
