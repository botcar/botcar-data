EXTRACTS FROM THE JOURNAL OF MRS. ANN 

MANIGAULT 
1754-1781 

With notes by Mabel L. Webber 

This Journal, or Diary, was kept by Mrs. Ann (Ashby) Mani- 
gault, wife of Gabriel Manigault, the wealthy merchant, for many 
years Public Treasurer, and reputed to be the richest man of this 
Province in the eighteenth century. It has been used by several 
historians from time to time, especially by General McCrady; 
and, while the entries are brief, and we have only abstracts of the 
original, it gives a valuable outline of the happenings of the 
period. 

The copy which is used here, was made by Gabriel Manigault, 
grandson to the writer, who puts in occasional conunents of his 
own. 

Mrs. Ann Manigault was the daughter of John Ashby, second 
Cassique, and Constantia Broughton; she married Gabriel Mani- 
gault in 1730, and died in April 1782, her husband died in June 
1781.

55 years, having lived 50 years in this Province. He had no children, and 
his will generously provided for the relations of both of his wives, some cousins 
of his own, and for the French church, the Baptist chiuch, St. Philips, and the 
Protestant Dissenters ''to whom the brick Meeting house towards the North-

for some Time past been afflicted with the Calamities of War, and had their 
Back-Settlements laid Waste by the most cruel Incursions of merciless Sav- 
ages while this Colony, surrounded with numerous Nations of Indians has 
been wonderfully preserved in Peace and Security, notwithstanding our 
manifold Sins had justly deserved severe Punishment: And it being our Duty

** S. C, Gamette, June 17, 1756. Last Sunday Morning between 1 and 2 
O'clock, a Fire (which is supposed may have been maliciously kindled by 
some hellish Incendiary) broke out amongst a Parcel of Pitch that lay upon 
Colonel Beale's Wharf, and burnt with such Violence, that, although the 
Town Engins were there in a short Time, and played with great Judgement, 
and upward of 100 men from the Winchelsea and Jamaica assisted, who were 
very active and serviceable, it consumed all the Stores on the said Wharf, 
with what was in them, before its Progress could be stopped. His Excel- 
lency the Governor, tho' remote from it, was among the first at the Spot, 
upon the Alann of Fire, and having immediately given such Directions as were 
necessaiy upon this Occasion and on account of the Number of Acadians 
here, Staid 'till the Fire was totally extinguished â€” ^Providentially it was 
calm; for had the Wind been blowing from the Westward (it being Low- 
Water) none of the Vessels lying at that and some other adjacent Wharves, 
nor a great number of Stores, full of Valuable Merchandize could have been 
saved; or had it been Easterly, all the Trading Part of the Town might have 
been destroyed, or at least must have suffered very considerably â€” ^In the 
Stores that have been consumed were about 160 Barrels of Rice, 7 Hogshead 
of Sugar, 5 of Rum, 1 Cask of Indico, 40 Coils of Cordage some Flour and 
many other articles; the Quantity of Pitch burnt was about 50 Barreb.

â€¢Lt. Col. (afterwards General) Henry Bouquet, 1719-1765; bom at RoUe, 
in the Canton of Berne, Switzerland; an able soldier of fortune. After serv- 
ing with distinction on the continent, at the outbreak of the French and 
Indian war in 1754, he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal American 
Regiment. His career in America has been well covered in The Annals of the 
King's Royal Rifle Corps, London, 1913. He died in Florida in 1765. A (manu- 
script) Journal kept by the Commissioners of Fortifications of South Carolina 
(now in the S. C. Hist, Soc.) gives several commimications from Colonel Bouquet 
concerning the fortifications about Charles-Town, and the Gazettes of this period 
contain a number of communications from the Governor and the Assembly 
concerning the building and repairing of fortifications, barracks and like build- 
ings. It b quite evident that the Province was very reluctant to furnish funds 
for this purpose; and there is controversy over the kind of material to be used; 
the new engineers demanding stone, and the local people contending for tabby. 
Bouquet's account of his stay in South Carolina is not very flattering; (Annals 
Kings R, R. Corps, p. 35). He complains that the provincial authorities 
refused to give the men decent quarters; refused even to provide them with 
straw; there was much desertion; Charles-Town was so unhealthy, the air so 
infected, that even the horses died. The Camp was full of water; the mortality 
great; not until the 21st of September had billets been provided for 160 men; 
after five months of Carolina, Col. Bouquet had but 300 men fit for duty; 
over and above all other troubles, there were symptoms of an epidemic of mat- 
rimony among the officers; '^Captain Lander has married one of our local beau- 
ties'' he wrote, ^^I hope it will spread no further as there is no great temptation.'' 
In February, 1758, the Assembly supplied the troops with better quarters, but 
too late to be of any benefit to Colonel Bouquet, who with his five companies 
were recalled to New York. 

The marriage which so bothered him, was that of Francis Lander to Eliza- 
beth Simpson, October 16, 1757 (St. Philip's Register), Capt Lander about a 
year later is trying to sell his commission. 

* Thomas, son of Christopher and Mary Gadsden, bom Aug. 13, 1757 (St.

The news paper file of South Carolina papers is broken from August, 1757, to 
November, 1758, leaving a bad break at this period. 

M He was baptized by the Rev. Robert Smith (St Phil^ Register). 

>* She was Elizabeth Pagett (1742-1771) daughter of John Pagett (1716- 
1747) of St Thomas Parish, and his wife Constantia Hasdl (1721- ), a 
daughter of Rev. Thomas Hasell and his wife Elizabeth Ashby, sister to Mrs. 
Ann Manigault. Constantia married first John Pagett, and second George 
Paddon Bond (Register of St. Thomas and St. Denis) Mrs. Ann Manigault 
was thus the great aunt of Elizabeth Pagett, who married the Rev. Robert 
Smith, and died June 8, 1771, without surviving issue. They were married 
by Rev. Charles Martyn of St Andrew's parish, and an ante-nuptial marriage 
bond was given 8 July, 1758, by Robert Smith, clerk, to William Gibbes of 
Charles-Town, and Andrew Hasell of St Thomas parish, planter .... 
marriage intended between said Robert Smith, clerk, and Elizabeth Pagett, 
spinster, a minor, marriage settlement to be executed within three months 
after marriage. The marriage settlement is dated 7 October, 175S, Andrew 
Hasell, Gabriel Manigault, Christopher Gadsden and William Gibbes were the 
trustees (Probate Court, Charleston, 1758-1763, p. 103, 105). Mrs. Manigault 
may not have been informed concerning the approaching marriage, but from 
the dates of the above marriage bond, it is quite evident that some of Miss 
Pagett's relations or guardians had been informed, and given their consent. 

" St. PhiUps Register. July 13, 1758. "Was buried Charles Pinckney." 
He died after an illness of three weeks, of fever contracted from visiting his 
plantations at this season. {Eliza Pinckney , p. 167).

Officers on the late Expedition [against the Cherokees] and Capt. Gadsden with 
the Gentlemen of his Company of Artillery that went Voluntiers, arrived in Tow

where they saluted his Excellency with 3 VoUies and 3 Cheers, which they re-

was concluded with numerous and curious illuminations. Bonfires and other 
Demonstrations of that Satisfaction and joy, which the almost unexpected 
Success of our Expedition had occasioned. 

By Gentlemen who left some of the Cherokee Towns the ist. Instant, we learn, 
that the Indians then behaved with the utmost Humility, Complaisance and 
Hospitality, and seemed as if they could not shew enough Respect to the white

'^ The small-pox epidemic of 1759-60 seems to have been very severe (see

.... 'twill be prudent in all Persons that go upon Parties of Pleasure, 
to avoid going ashore there, lest they be obliged to stay longer than they in- 
tended." From this time on the papers contain items concerning smallpox 
remedies, treatment, arguments for and against inoculations. The Assembly

where they are to land the same, in order to be immediately tran^x>rted in

out on their march from hence, to begin the campaign; they consist of 4 com-

EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL OF BIRS. ANN ICAmGAULT 137 

The weather having been cloudy and windy from S. by W. and S.W. on 
Sunday night, and monday before noon the scud flying very fast; towards two 
o'clock P.M. some people being alarmed by an unusual noise, not unlike the 
rattling of many coach-wheels on a rough pavement at a little distance, ran out, 
and observed a stupendous thick pillar of clouds, about 30 or 35 deg. high, and 
seemingly 250 yards broad, moving rapidly, but somewhat in an oblique, from 
Wappoo-creek across Ashley-River towards the town; the clouds in view flying 
with great velocity from all points as if attracted into the vortex, whereby its 
diameter was greatly increased, so as in appearance to equal 300 fathoms. 

When this alarming congestion of the elements came near the sugar house at 
the upper end of Broad-street, it turned again more southwardly, and followed 
the course of the river to Rebellion-Road, passing thence over the marsh a little 
north of SullivantVisland, and through Long-island, stiU more northly, into 
the sea. In its progress down Ashley river it seemed to impel the water into 
a mountainous wave about 12 feet high, 'till it passed Broughton's bastion, 
leaving bare a great part of the river on both sides of the Channel that had 
never been seen dry before; irregular columns of water, of a good height rising 
into the clouds at the same time, which resembled pillars of white marble, from 
the foam the water was agitated into, and abating for the solemnity of the oc- 
casion, exhibited a grand scene in perspective, through the darker medium of 
opaque clouds. As the clouds were rolled over and over with astonishing con- 
fusion, bushes, branches, and leaves of trees, birds, &c. were tossed about in 
the storm in the most tumultous manner; the whole being attended with a 
roaring, rumbling and dashing mixture of noise, lightening, thunder, and 
very large hail stones, the water falling rather in qx>uts than as rain from these 
complicated clouds, according to the relation of those who were exposed to it. 

About the same time another water-spout, with a storm of wind came from 
towards the N.E., down Cooper River, part of which crossed the neck of land 
above the gate, and united or was attracted to the other in Ashley-River, and 
the remainder passed into Rebellion-Road, almost at the same instant this did. 

We had a fleet of 40 sail, with its convoy, in Rebellion-Road, waiting for a 
wind to put to sea; but so rapid was the progress of the storm, that there was 
not the least time to provide for its coming, although from the formidableness 
of its appearance it was thought to teem with mischief; for it was but a very 
few minutes (3 or 5 at most) in its passage down, and laid every vessell in its 
course on her beam-ends, some with several streaks of their decks, and many 
with the ends of their top-sail yards in the water, sinking one ship, three snows, 
and a sloop out right, and wholly or in part dismantling many other vessels, 
with the loss of boats, anchors, cables, &c. and more would probably have foimd- 
ered, had not the counter storm which came from the N.E. when it changes its 
course down Cooper-River towards the Road, instantly set them right again as 
they lay on their sides, the whole being over in less than two minutes; Yet 
notwithstanding the prodigious violence and suddenness of the storm, provi- 
dentially not more than 4 lives were lost in the fleet, vis, Mr. Nathaniel Polbill, 
a passenger in Capt. Muir's vessel, and Mr. Robert Kay the captain's nephew, 
a man from on board capt. Maillard's ship, and a boy from capt Clark's snow. 

This awful phenomenon was probably only a whirlwind in the country.

wfaicfa, when it came over the rivers, gave rise to a water spout. The dixectbii 
of the fonner was not in a straight line but in a zigzag manner; for, as far as 
we have been able to trace it, it was first seen crosstng Spoon-Savannah, aboat 
W. by S. from this; then passed in a line over Ferguson's swamp, and thence W. 
by N. to Mr. George Sommers's plantations at Stono, which lie W. by N. from 
town about 25 miles distant; at one of which it destroyed all the buildings and 
killed a white woman. From thence its course was to the southward of W. 
to-wards JohnVIsland where it destroyed all of Col. Alexander's Hezt's build- 
ings and fences; then it moved in a W. by S. course, levding the buildings on 
the late Rev. Mr. Hutson and Mr. William Glen's plantation at Wappoo, 
taking off the roof of the dwelling house and destroying all the out houses on 
Mr. William Henderson's settlement, killing and dangerously wounding several 
negroes, cattle &c. It continued in a W. by S. course over Ashley-River, and 
forming an angle with Broughton's battery proceeded directly Â£. towards 
Rebellion-Road. 

As this happened nearly at low-water, the tide instantly retired in so extra- 
ordinary a manner as to leave capt Forten's ship dry, which rode afloat at the 
end of Mr. Motte's wharf, and it returned as suddenly again, and with so pro- 
digious a swell that it was expected the sh^ would be thrown upon the wharf; 
the same lu4>pened to the other vessels that lay dry in the neighboring docks, 
which were in a moment filled with water. It overflowed a high bank, which 
spring-tides never reach, at capt. Williams' near Sullivant's-Island: And Capt. 
Mounsay, who was returning on board after clearing his vessel at Fort John- 
son, and thought himself 4 feet above the level of the water, says, it inmiedi- 
ately swelled so as to reach his breast, rising about 8 feet in an instant. 

How far it extended into the sea, we know not; but the sloop of capt. Elias 
Young (who arrived here last Wednesday from Bermuda) being that after noon 
about 4 o'clock in 17 fathoms water, above ten leagues from the land, and five 
miles N. of the latitude of Sullivant's island, had her deck's covered with leaves 
of bushes and trees; and the master reports that altho' the wind vras high all 
the day, yet the swell was much greater than could have been expected from 
such a gale, according to what usually happens at sea 

*^ The Manigaults and their friends do not seem to have regarded in any way 
the danger of being in the country in the summer, and seem to find no connec- 
tion between these frequent visits to their plantations, and the attacks of fever 
which followed immediately. Peter Manigault had bought a country place at 
Goose Creek, and, as is shown in the Diary, they went there for short stays at 
any season of the year; later, it was considered most dangerous to be in the 
country after sundown, between May and November.

mendoD of that subject used to produce in him â€” ^he was more cahn but yet in- 
flexible. I am heartily sorry for it, on his own account â€” & besides being wrong 
in its nature such conduct is a bar to that mutual intercourse and happiness 
which would otherwise subsist between all their friends. My family thank God 
are all well but my wife a little harrassed with the care of her Brother's Children

**Mary Mackenae, second daughter of George Mackenzie, third earl of 
Cromarty (who died 1766), and his wife Isabella, daughter of Sir l^^lliam Gor- 
don, Bart, of Invergordon. George Mackenzie, with his oldest son John,

Drayton, Esq.; third 17th January, 1762, John Ainsley, Esq.; fourth, January, 
1776, Hon. Henry Middleton. She had a son named A. Mackenzie, for the 
Morning Post June 5, 1786 gives the arrival of ''A M'Kenzie Esq; son of Lady 
Mary Middleton by a former marriage, after an absence of eighteen years from 
his family and friends." Unless he was her son by her marriage with Capt. 
Clark, and took the name of Mackenzie, then she must have been married five 
times. She died at sea, 21 November, 1788 (Dici. Nat, Biog; Burke's Peerages; 
S. C. H. and G, Maga,, vol. 1, p. 242).
