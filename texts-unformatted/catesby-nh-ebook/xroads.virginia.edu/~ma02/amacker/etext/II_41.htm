            <h1>Of Serpents. </h1>
            <p>I have seen in Carolina eighteen or nineteen Sorts of Serpents; 
              whereof four are of the Viper kind, the others of the Snake kind. 
              It is well known, that the most distinguishing Characteristicks 
              of the Viper is, that it brings forth its young alive; and of the 
              Snake, that it lays Eggs, out of which its young are afterwards 
              hatch'd. But besides this Difference, the Viper has long hollow 
              Fangs or Toils, with an opening near the Point, thro' which they 
              inject their Poison when they bite; its other Teeth are like those 
              of Snakes: Besides which I have observed the following external 
              Marks; the Viper hath the Neck small, the Head broad, the Cheeks 
              extending wide, their Scales rough, the Body short and thick in 
              most; is slow of Motion, can swell his Head and Neck when irritated; 
              hath the Aspect terrible and ugly: Whereas Snakes have the head 
              small, the Body long, the Scales smooth, are nimble and of an harmless 
              Aspect. All Serpents, as well Vipers as Snakes, have forked Tongues, 
              which serve to catch the Insects they feed on; when they are disturbed 
              they thrust them out of their Mouth and shake them.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Vipera Caudisona Americana: The Rattle-Snake.</h1>
            <p>Of these Vipers the Rattle Snake is most formidable, being the 
              largest and most terrible of all the rest: The largest I ever saw, 
              was one about eight Feet in Length, weighing between eight and nine 
              Pounds: This Monster was gliding into the House of Colonel <b>Blake</b>, 
              of <b>Carolina</b>; and had certainly taken his Aboad there undiscovered, 
              had not the Domestick Animals allarmed the Family with their repeated 
              Outcries; the Hogs, Dogs and Poultry united in their Hatred to him, 
              shewing the greatest Consternation, by erecting their Bristles and 
              Feathers, and expressing their Wrath and Indignation, surrounded 
              him, but carefully kept their Distance; while he, regardless of 
              their Threats, glided slowly along.</p>
            <p> It is not uncommon to have them come into Houses, a very extraordinary 
              Instance of which happen'd to my self in the same Gentleman's House, 
              in the Month of <b>February</b> 1723; the Servant in making the 
              Bed in a Ground Room, (but a few Minutes after I left it) on turning 
              down the Cloaths, discovered a Rattle-Snake, lying coiled between 
              the Sheets, in the middle of the Bed.</p>
            <p>They are the most inactive and slow moving Snake of all others, 
              and are never the Aggressors, except in what they prey upon; for 
              unless they are disturbed they will not bite, and when provoked, 
              they give Warning by shaking their Rattles. These are commonly believed 
              to be the most deadly venomous Serpent of any in there Parts of 
              <b>America</b>, I believe they are so, as being generally the largest, 
              and making a deeper Wound, and injecting a greater Quanity of Poison; 
              tho' I know not why any of the three other kinds of Vipers may not 
              be as venomous as a Rattle-Snake, if as big, the Structure of their 
              deadly Fangs being formed alike in all. The most successful Remedy 
              the <b>Indians</b> seem to have, is to suck the Wound, which in 
              a slight Bite has sometimes a good Effect; tho' the recovered Person 
              never fails of having annual Pains at the Time they were bit. They 
              have likewise some Roots, which they pretend will effect the Cure, 
              particularly a kind of <b>Assarum</b>, commonly called <b>Heart-Snake-root</b>, 
              a kind of <b>Chrysanthemum</b>, called St. <b>Anthony's Cross</b>, 
              and some others; but that which they rely on most, and which most 
              of the <b>Virginian</b> and <b>Carolina Indians</b> carry dry in 
              their Pockets, is a small tuberous Root, which they procure from 
              the remote Parts of the Country; this they chew, and swallow the 
              juice, applying some to the Wound. Having by travelling much with 
              <b>Indians</b>, had frequent Opportunities of seeing the direful 
              Effects of the Bites of these Snake, it always seemed and was apparent 
              to me, that the good Effects usually attributed to these their Remedies, 
              is owing more to the Force of Nature, or the Slightness of the Bite 
              of a small Snake in a muscular Part, &c. The Person thus bit, I 
              have known to survive without any Assistance for many Hours, but 
              where a Rattle-Snake with full Force penetrates with his deadly 
              Fangs, and pricks a Vein or Artery, inevitable Death ensues, and 
              that, as I have often seen, in less than two Minutes. The <b>Indians</b> 
              know their Destiny the Minute they are bit, and when they perceive 
              it mortal, apply no Remedy, concluding all Efforts in vain. If the 
              Bite happeneth in a fleshy Part, they immediately cut it out, to 
              stop the Current of the Poison. I could heartily wish, that Oil 
              of Olives immediately applied to the Wound, might have as good Success 
              against the Venom of these Snakes, as it hath been found in <b>England</b> 
              to have had against the Poison Of the common Adder.</p>
            <p>The Colour of the head of this Rattle-Snake is brown, the Eye red, 
              the Upper Part of the Body of a brownish yellow, transversely marked 
              with irregular broad black Lifts. The Rattle is of a brown Colour, 
              composed of several Horney membranous Cells, of an undulated pyramidal 
              Figure, which are articulated one within the other, so that the 
              Point of the first Cell reaches as far as the Basis or protuberant 
              Ring of the third and so on, which Articulation being very loose, 
              gives Liberty to the Parts of the Cells that are inclosed within 
              the outward Rings, to strike against the Sides of them, and so to 
              cause the rattling Noise, which is heard when the Snake shakes its 
              Tail. I have given a Section of a Rattle, that this Structure might 
              the better appear.</p>
            <p>The Charming, as it's commonly called, or attractive Power this 
              Snake is said to have of drawing to it Animals, and devouring them, 
              is generally believed in <b>America</b>; as for my own part, I never 
              saw the Action, but a great many from whom I have had it related, 
              all agree in the manner of the Process; which is, that the Animals, 
              particularly Birds and Squirrels (which principally are their Prey) 
              no sooner spy the Snake than they skip from Spray to Spray, hovering 
              and approaching gradually nearer their Enemy regardless of any other 
              Danger; but with distracted Gestures and Outcries descend, tho' 
              from the top of the loftiest Trees to the Mouth of the Snake, who 
              openeth his Jaws, take them in, and in an Instant swallows them.</p>
