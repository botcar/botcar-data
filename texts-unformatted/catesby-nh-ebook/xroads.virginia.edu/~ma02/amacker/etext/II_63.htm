            <h1>Lacertus omnium maximus, Crocodilus: The Alligator.</h1>
            <p>The Largeness, Strength, and terrible Appearance of this formidable 
              Animal, occasioning to be to often observed and described, I conceive 
              it less necessary to be so particular in its description as otherwise 
              I should be in so remarkable a Creature: I shall therefore endeavour 
              to observe some Things which have been omitted by others. They are 
              amphibious, and tho' the largest and greatest Numbers inhabit the 
              <b>Torrid</b> <b>Zone</b>, the Continent abounds with them ten Degrees 
              more North, particularly as far as the River<b> Nous</b> in <b>North 
              Carolina</b>, in the Latitude of about 33, beyond which I have never 
              heard of any which Latitude nearly answers to the Northermost Parts 
              of <b>Africa</b>, where they are likewise found. They frequent not 
              only salt Rivers near the Sea, but Streams of fresh Water in the 
              Upper Parts of the Country, and in Lakes of salt and fresh Water, 
              on the Banks of which they lye lurking among Reeds, to suprise Cattle 
              and other Animals.</p>
            <p>In <b>Jamaica</b> and many Parts of the Continent they are found 
              above twenty Foot in Length: They cannot be more terrible in their 
              Aspect than they are formidable, and mischievous in their Natures, 
              sparing neither Man nor Beast they can surprize, pulling them under 
              Water, that being dead, they may with greater Facility and without 
              Struggle, or Resistance, devour them. As Quadrupeds do not to often 
              come in their Way, they mostly subsist on Fish, but as Providence, 
              for the Preservation, or to prevent the Extinction, of defenceless 
              Creatures, hath in many Instances restrain'd the devouring Appetites 
              of voracious Animals, by some Impediment or other, so this destructive 
              Monster, by the close Connexion of the Joints of his <b>Vertebra</b>, 
              can neither swim nor run any other Ways than strait forward, and 
              is consequently disabled from turning with that Agility, requisite 
              to catch his Prey by Pursuit, therefore they do it by Surprize in 
              the Water, as well as by Land; for effecting of which Nature seems 
              in some measure to have recompensed their Want of Agility, by giving 
              them a Power of deceiving and catching their Prey, by a Sagacity 
              peculiar to them, as well as by the outer Form and Colour of their 
              Body, which on Land resembles an old dirty Log or Tree, and in the 
              Water frequently lies floating on the Surface, and there has the 
              like Appearance, by which and his silent Artifice, Fish, Fowl, Turtle, 
              and all other Animals are deceived, suddenly catch'd and devoured.</p>
            <p>Carnivorous Animals get their Food with more Difficulty and lets 
              Certainty than others, and are often necessitated to fast a long 
              Time, which a slow Concoction enables them to endure: Reptiles particularly, 
              by swallowing what they eat whole, digest slowly, eat seldom, and 
              live long without Food. Wolves are said to gorge themselves with 
              Mud, to supply the Want of better Food; for the like Cause may Alligators 
              swallow Stones and other Substances, to distend and prevent the 
              Contraction of their Intestines when empty, and not to help Digestion, 
              which they seem to be in no Need of. For in the greater Number of 
              many I have opened, nothing has appeared but chumps of <b>Lightwood</b> 
              and Pieces of Pine Tree Coal, some of which weighed eight Pounds, 
              and were reduced and wore to smooth from their first angular roughness, 
              that they seemed to have remained in them many Months. They lay 
              a great Number of Eggs at one Time, in the sandy Banks of Rivers 
              and Lakes, which are hatched by the Heat of the Sun, without further 
              Care of the Parents. The young ones so soon as they are disengaged 
              from their Shells, betake them to the Water and shift for themselves; 
              but while young they serve as a Prey, not only to ravenous Fish, 
              but to their own Species. It is to be admired that so vaft an Animal 
              should at first be contained to an Egg, no bigger than that of a 
              Turkey.</p>
            <p>In South <b>Carolina</b> they are very rat numerous, but the Northern 
              Situation of that Country, occasions their being of a smaller Size 
              than those nearer the <b>Line</b>, and they rarely attack Men or 
              Cattle, yet are great Devourers of Hogs. In <b>Carolina</b> they 
              lie torpid from about <b>October</b> to<b> March</b>, in Caverns 
              and Hollows in the Banks of Rivers; and at their coming out in the 
              Spring, make an hideous bellowing Noise. The Hind-part of their 
              Belly and Tail are eat by the <b>Indians</b>. The Flesh is delicately 
              white, but has so perfumed a Taste and Smell, that I could never 
              relish it with Pleasure. The Figure here exhibited, represents the 
              Size and Figure of an Alligator, soon after the breaking out of 
              the Shell.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Candela Americana, foliis Laurinis, flore tetrapetalo luteo, fructu 
              angustiore: The Mangrove Tree.</h1>
            <p>These Trees vary in Height, being in some Places twenty, in others 
              above thirty Feet high, in Proportion to the Depth or Richness of 
              the muddy Soil in which they grow. The Bark is smooth, of a light 
              brown, in the smaller Branches inclining to red: The Leaves are 
              somewhat like those of the Bay, with their middle Veins yellow, 
              having Inch long Foot-stalks: The smaller Branches are jointed at 
              the Distance of every Inch: The Flowers grow usually two or three 
              together, and sometimes on single Footstalks, of two or three Inches 
              in Length, having each four yellow Petals, which before they open 
              are covered with a greenish <b>Calyx</b>, dividing into four Parts; 
              the Flower is suceeded by green succulent Substances, in Form not 
              unlike a Pear, at the small End of which hang a single Seed, about 
              six Inches in Length, in Form of a Bobin, with which Lace is made. 
              These Seeds when they fall, are carried floating on the Water, and 
              lodged on muddy Banks, where their larger Ends settle in the Mud, 
              and take Root, the smaller Ends sprouting, as in the Figure. These 
              Trees propagate not only by their Seeds in this Manner, but the 
              smaller Branches falling into the Mud strike Root, and in a few 
              Years become Trees, which increase in like Manner, and extend their 
              Progress some Miles.</p>
            <p>In shallow Salt Water these impenetrable Woods of Mangroves, are 
              frequented by great Numbers of Alligators, which being too big to 
              enter the closest Recesses of these Thickets, the smaller ones find 
              a secure Retreat from the Jaws of their voracious Parents; These 
              watery Woods are also plentifully stored with ravenous Fish, Turtles, 
              and other Animals, which prey continually one upon the other, and 
              the Alligators on them all, so that in no Place have I ever seeen 
              such remarkable Scenes of Devastation as amongst these Mangroves, 
              in <b>Andros</b>, one of the <b>Bahama</b> Islands, where the Fragments 
              of half devoured Carcasses were usually floating on the Water. They 
              grow in most Parts of the Earth under the <b>Torrid Zone</b>, and 
              are found but a little North or South of the <b>Tropicks</b>. <b>
