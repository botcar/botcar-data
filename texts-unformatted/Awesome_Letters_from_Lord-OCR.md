EARLY LETTERS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA UPON
NATURAL HISTORY
The letters printed below are from the Sloane Manuscripts, in
the British Museum. There is some doubt as to whom they were written; Prof. Charles M. Andrews, in the _Guide to Manuscript Materials for the History of the United Slates to 1783_,  pp. 51, 69, lists them as letters to Sir Hans Sloane; but Mr. J. A. Herbert, assistant keeper of Mss., British Museum, writes that the Sloane Mss. contains besides the letters to Sir Hans Sloane, "some to Dr. Browne and Mr. Petiver;" The letters of Hannah Williams and Joseph Lord, have been indexed in _Index to the Sloane_ Mss., E. J. L. Scott, as letters to James Petiver. An account of Petiver can be found in the _Dictionary of National Biography_. 

Hannah Williams who writes the first letter given here, was in South Carolina before 1692, for as Hannah English widow, she gets a warrant, dated October 25, 1692, for 500 acres of land near Stony Point[1] and in May, 1695, she had another warrant under the name of "Hannah English, alias Williams." She may have been the widow of Mathew English, who arrived here in February 1670, and had a warrant for a town lot as late as 1689.[2] She was certainly the mother of Henroyda English,[3] and married William Williams between 1692 and 1694. Williams arrived with his wife and child 24 December, 1683. He made his will 2d November,

1710, proved 26th October, 1711, as William Williams of Carolina planter, and gives to his son-in-law Henroyda English, all of his estate, real and personal. Hannah Williams, widow to William Williams, dedares the above will to have been made with her consent. [4]


The will of Charles Clarke, of Berkley County, dated November 2, 1694, mentions Mrs. Mary Spragg, daughter of Mrs. Hannah Williams, to whom he leaves a house and lot, bounding on late belonging to Gov. Thomas Smith. Mentions also William Williams, gentleman, of Carolina, and leaves the remainder of his property to William Williams and Mrs. Mary Spragg.[5] 

Mrs. Hannah Williams was buried December 16, 1722.[6] 

Joseph Lord, who writes the other letters, was the pastor under whom the settlers from Dorchester Mass. immigrated to the place in South Carolina, which they afterwards named Dorchester also. "ocktober ye 20-95 was mr. Joseph Lord and Increase Sumner and William pratt were dismissed for ye gathering of A church for ye South corelina."[7] 

Joseph Lord was of Charlestown, Mass. He had graduated at Harvard in the class of 1691, and at the time of his removal to Carolina, was teaching school, and studying theology in Dorchester. He remained in South Carolina for twenty-five years, returning to Massachusetts in 1720, and on the 15th of June of that year was installed over the church at Chatham, where he remained until his death, June 6th. 1748.[8] 

His  sister, Abigail, married John Stevens, who was one of the leading men in the Dorchester settlement, and the ancestor of the present Stevens family in lower South Carolina. John Stevens probably came from New England also, since in his will, dated December 24, 1717, he directs that his sons Samuel and John "be brought up at the college in New England to good lerning… and my brother Will Titcomb have care of them… ;" he also leaves a legacy to Joseph Lord Jr., upon con­
dition that he also be sent to college.

Next Spring I will send you some Mocking birds  &  Red birds if I should send you any Now the Could would Kill them." 

[In a different hand and possibly the same hand and ink as the date of the letter's receipt at the head:

"Mr. Leigh Husband in Aldermanbury" There is no address on the back of the letter, but Andrews & Davenport say it is to "Sloane," Dr. Scott, Late Head of the MSS. Dept. of the British Museum, said it was to "James Pettiver" to whom the next letter in the MS. Sloane, 4064 is addressed, and at the bottom of the letter itself though not in Hannah Williams' hand, is "Mr. Leigh Husband."]

Sir
Since that w' came by Pensylvania, Dated, Nov. 17, 1706. I have rec . no Lett' from you. I sent a Lett' & a Box of Collections by Capt. Gill Belcher, y' last year (y' Lett'. dated, Jan. 2, 170jf, w' I hope are come to hand. In yo' last y' I rec~., you mention a Bill of a Bird we was sent either by Mad~ Williams or me, concerning w' I have since written you word, y'. I did not rememb' y' I sent you any such: but I call to mind y' I sent you y' Bill of a Garr-fish, w' has sharp teeth set all along both sides: of w' I have also one now ready to send you, as I have also Divers oth' things w' I have collected. Anoth' sort of Tortoise, y' that w' you sent me y' figure of marked 76.4. I have y' shell of, w' I intend to send you e' er long. Here are divers sorts of y ., tho' I don't often meet w'h y . The shell 71.8 & 71.9 is, I suppose, y' w' y' wood-snail carries on his back, & houses himself in. I have sent divers of y~, if I forget not, but perhaps they might be broken before they came at you, for I find y very brittle. The Centipes, 74.3 is very like a worm w' us, w' w' it dies, gathers almost into a cirde as yo' figure represents: but w y' worm is liveing, as it crawls, that side w" y' feet are seems fht. You figure a  C ary,  80.9. w' I don't know w' distinguishes from oth' shells: but yo' figure puts me in mind of a sort of Insect here, y' is covered w'" hair, between chestnut & ash colour; y' belly w" of is flat, & y' two sides run up to a ridge, w~ is long' hair y on y' rest of y' body, & carries some resemblance of hog'  s bristles. The insect is ab' an inch long, & ab'. half an inch broad at y' belly; & ab'. as deep from y' ridge to y' belly. The year before last came a neighbo' to me in great pain, & heart-sick, by being bitten by one of y in y' neck; & would (for ought I know) have died, if suitable remedies both inward & outward, had not been applied. I had observed y' insect before, & would have sent it to you, if I had known how. Yo' desire thereof prevailed

Tkc P arings] That w' is here called a Partridge, we called a Quail in N. Eng14., w' seems to be of y' colo' spoken of in this place: but we had a Partridge in  N.

Also wa I was a boy I caught another sort of red Sparrow; but have forgot wherein it differed from other sparrows, except in being Red. They were rare there. I have some notion y'. I then reckoned it of y same species w'h that w' . a red head: divers whereof had reddish Breasts too: whether it were those y'. were old' y others, I cannot tell. 94.  The Black Sparrmo]  we had in  N.  Engl~. a sparrow w'h. a red spot on y' head; but y' body was of a greyish brown colo'. There is also a Sparrow here y'. is like that of N. England; only y' spot on y' head is not so red. I have heard them in N. Engl~. called Tom Tits. 95.  Tkc  Blnoisk  SParrom]  We have here a Sparrow y' is between blew 8I ash-colo' whose bill is white, 8I his belly 8I y' outermost feath' on each side of his tail. 96-101. Divers  Starl&sgs  are mentioned, 8r described. We have here two or three sorts of Back birds w' flock togeth' y' male of one sort has a scarlet spot on each wing;  Bt  y' female is a dark grey almost black. 103. Tkc Smallom] The male, here, is shineing black on his back, head,  BI  breast; y' female more muddy, 8t on y' breast of a yellowish brown  colo'.  108.  Tkc Tkrostle]  That wo was called, in N. Engl~., a Robin (but at Dorchest' in New England, a Fieldfare) I have heard a Lancashire man call a Throstle: It comes hither in y' Wint', but is not seen here in y' summ'. 110.111. We have a  Turtle  dose here, but wheth' y' leggs be red or white or eith' I can't now say; but I think y> are red. The New-England wild Pidgeon, is also a large sort of Turtle, w'" red leggs: they come hith' sometimes in y' Wint'. 114-116. Wood peck"] We have three or four sorts; some as large as Teal.

"Worthy Sir,
Yo~ of Mar. 15, 17zs I received Jun. 30: wrapped up in a Monthly Mercury for January last, w'". some oth' Prints, w' is y' erst News book or Pap' I ev' received, of all y' ev' you sent. You write you are glad to understand I received y' things y'. you sent last year, & I sh~ have been glad I c~ have given you to understand y' you were rightly informed; for I much regret y' loss of y' box h w' was in it. But not going to Charlestown myself, I wrote to desire my friend, M' Samuel Evdeigh, to enquire of him ab' it; who sent me word y'. Capt. Bdch' s~ there was indeed such a Box, but he had delivered it to some body, he c~ not tell who; so I nev' saw it. I thought (as I had written to you) y'. he w~. have been more carefull than so. I received, indeed, y' lett' y'. gave an account of it, gr w' was enclosed therein:  8r delivered to M'. Henchman's widow, y' lett' directed to him, but what you sent to him being put into my box, she came short as well as I. I don't know weth' yo' directing to me near stony point (from w' my habitation is 14 or 15 miles distant)mayn't be some disadvantage to me. M' Henchman (as Capt. Belch' informed you) died suddenly of an Apoplexy last Novemb' was twelve month. I have spoken w'" his wife ab' what he left in writeing, wo I had looked ov' while he was alive; h she promises to lend y me to take copies of, w'.

much y'. I w~ of this nature. Before y' comeing of yo' form' by Capt. Belch', w' I rec~. not till Jun. 16, 1709. tho' it were dated Nov. 30, 1708. I wrote a lett' to you, wherein I proceeded w'". my observations (such as they were) on yo' Natural History of Brasile, as far as y' end of y' second chapt' w' speaks of Birds: wherein also I informed you, y'. I sent no bill of a bird, yet I had sent y' bill of a Garr-fish, w', perhaps, you might take for y' bill of a fowl; w' I mention here, because yo~ mentions nothing of that lett', w' makes me suspect it's miscarriage. I have a small Box of Collections ready, & sh have had more, but partly y' inconvenience of doing it w'"out collecting-books, partly my much oth' necessary business, & partly y' confusions & distractions of y' countrey, especially at this time, w 4, tho' I would, I cannot altogeth' avoid all concern in, have been an hindrance to me; & w' all being at a great distance from Charlestown, I find great difficulty in getting thith' what I have to send, & many times lose y' opportunity of y' Ship, before I can obtain a conveyance from hence to Charlstown. In that Box I have put such anoth' bill, besides many oth' things, w' I cannot now particularly enumerate. I w~ have sent y' box now, but I have no opportunity to send it to Charlstown. I w~. also have proceeded ' farth' in my observations upon yo' Natural History of Brasile, but time & oth' occasions, will not give leave. With thanks for w~ you have sent, both w' I have received, & w' I have not, I take y' boldness to request you, if you can obtain y' seed of Sena of Alexandria, y' you will please to send me a little. I have Italian Sena growing; but whether it be y' it contains more lixivious salt than y' oth', or y' y' Air of y' countrey is more moist y~ of oth' countrys w" Oriental Sena is kept or first dried, I cannot, w'" all y' care I can use, prevent it's turning black in a little time. Here is a sort of bindweed w' I am apt to conceit may be Scammony; w' I believe I may formerly have sent you y' branches of. If I sh~. send you that, or any oth' usefull drugg, if you will please to let me know it, you will much oblige, Sir,
Yo' humble Serv'.

Catherine Gale (Dalcho, p. 124), and Hannah Beale, his sister, married the Hon. William Bull; she died in England about 1795, when she made her will. Othniel Beale, was the son of Capt. John Beale and Martha his wife, of Marblehead, New England; this is so stated on the tombstone of Capt. William Beale, hste master of the Ship  Priscc oj Wafesi  who died December 5, 1736, aged 38 years. The stone was erected in the Circular (Congregational) Churchyard, by Capt. William Beale's brother, Othniel Beale.
Evidently the account of the death of Dennis Rolle (this M agazines, vol. xx,  p. 207) was an error, for he is mentioned as dining with Mrs. Manigault, November 29, 1767, and again here. Henry Laurens (Letter Bk. 1767-71, p. 77) mentions Rolle's coming from his village on St. John's River, to White Point on Ashley River, in a canoe, with one other person. The S.  C.  Gas. sad Celnlry Jour.  for January 16, 1770, mentions his arrival from East Florida, and his taking passage for London.
