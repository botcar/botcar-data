I observed it in flower at least a month ago."

About a month ?? weeks before I saw three Plants of the above Phalangium, &amp; not knowing how soon they would fade ??? gather them then; but the next day went to look for them, but could find but one; &amp; in that, the flower of the day before was full blown) together with the heads (I ??? about a Douzen) were sunk in between those two â€¦ that I could discern, but a little of any of them. This was in flower when I gathered it but the flowers are withered."

Gathered about the middle of May 1704. Here are two other sorts which are past before this shews it's self. One has a pale flower, like a Damask rose in color; the other a flower almost as red as a red rose. Both grow also higher than this, which seldom grows above 2 or 3 foot high; &amp; all by brooksides or other watery places. If you have met with the Temperature &amp; use of these, please to communicate them."

Those spots in the leaves that now (dried) look most green, when they are fresh look of the color of the liver of a beast, before it be sodden[?], as it is when taken out of the beast."
