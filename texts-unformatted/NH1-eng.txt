## Aquila Capite Albo: The Bald Eagle.

This bird weighs nine pounds: the Iris of the eye white; over which is a prominence, coverâ€™d with a yellow skin; the Bill yellow, with the Sear of the same colour: the Legs and Feet are yellow; the Tallons black; the Head and part of the Neck is white, as is the Tail; all the rest of the Body, and Wings, are brown.

Thoâ€™ it is an Eagle of a small size, yet has great strength and spirit, preying on Pigs, Lambs, and Fawns.

They always make their Nests near the sea, or great rivers, and usually on old, dead Pine or Cypress-trees, continuing to build annually on the same tree, till it falls. Tho' he is so formidable to all birds, yet he suffers them to breed near his royal nest without molestation; particularly the fishing and other Hawks, Herons, _&amp;c_. which all make their nests on high trees; and in some places are so near one another, that they appear like a Rookery. This Bird is called the BALD EAGLE, both in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, thoâ€™ his head is as much featherâ€™d as the other parts of his body.

Both Cock and Hen have white Heads, and their other parts differ very little from one another.

## Accipter Piscatorious : The Fishing Hawk. 
  
This Bird weighs three pounds and a quarter; from one end of the wing to the other extended, five foot, five inches: the Bill is black, with a blue sear; the Iris of the eye yellow; the Crown of the head brown, with a mixture of white feathers: from each Eye, backwards, runs a brown stripe; all the upper part of the Back, Wing and Tail, dark-brown; the Throat, Neck and Belly, white: the Legs and Feet are remarkably rough and scaly, and of a pale-blue colour; the Tallons black, and almost of an equal size: the Feathers of the Thighs are short, and adhere close to them, contrary to others of the Hawk kind; which nature seems to have designed for their more easy penetrating the water. 

Their manner of fishing is (after hovering a while over the water) to precipitate into it with prodigious swiftness; where it remains for some minutes, and seldom rises without a fish: which the Bald Eagle (which is generally on the watch) no sooner spies, but at him furiously he flies: the Hawk mounts, screaming out, but the Eagle always soars above him, and compels the Hawk to let it fall; which the Eagle feldom fails of catching, before it reaches the Water. It is remarkable, that whenever the Hawk catches a Fish, he calls, as if it were, for the Eagle; who always obeys the call, if within
hearing. 

The lower parts of the Rivers and Creeks near the sea abound most with these Eagles and Hawks, where these diverting contests are frequently seen.

## Accipiter Palumbarius : The Pigeon-Hawk. 

It weighs six ounces: the Bill at the point black, at the basis whitish; the Iris of the eye yellow: the Basis of the upper mandible is coverâ€™d with a yellow Sear: all the upper part of the Body, Wings and Tail is brown: the interior vanes of the quill-feathers have large red spots: the Tail is transversly marked with four white lines; the Throat, Breast and Belly white, intermixâ€™d with brown feathers; the small feathers that cover the thighs, reach within half an inch of the feet, and are white, with a tincture of red, beset with long spots of brown; the Legs and Feet yellow. It is a very swift and bold Hawk, preying on Pigeons and wild Turkeys while they are young.

## Accipter Cauda furcata: The Swallow-Tail Hawk.

It weighs fourteen ounces: the Back black and hooked, without angles on the sides of the upper Mandible, as in other Hawks; the Eyes very large, and black, with a red Iris: the Head, Neck, Breast and Belly white; the Upper-part of the Wing and Back, dark purple; but more dusky towards the lower parts, with a tincture of green; the Wings long, in proportion to the Body; they being extended, are four foot; the Tail dark purple, mixâ€™d with green, remarkably forked, the utmost and longest feather being eight inches longer than the middlemost, which is shortest.  

Like Swallows, they continue long on the wing, catching, as they fly, Beetles, Flies and other Insects, from trees and bushes. They are said to prey upon Lizards and other Serpents; which has given them (by some) the name of _Snake-Hawk_. I believe they are Birds of passage, not having seen any of them in winter.

# 5

## Accipter Minor: The Little Hawk

This Bird weighs three ounces 16 penny weight. The Basis of the upper Mandible is coverÕd with a yellow Sear: the Iris of the Eye yellow; the Head lead-colour, with a large red spot on its Crown: round the back of his head, are seven black spots regularly placed: the Throat and Cheeks are white, with a tincture of red; the Back red, and marked with transverse black lines: the Quill-feathers of the Wing dark-brown; the rest of the Wing blue, marked, as on the Back, with black: the Tail red, except an inch of the end, which is black;the Breast and Belly of a blueish red; the Legs and Feet yellow.

The Hen differs from the Cock, as follows: her whole Wing and Back is of the same colour as the Back of the Cock; the Tail of the Hen is marked, as on the Back, with transverse black lines; her Breast has not that stain of red as in the Cock. They abide all the year in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, preying not only on small birds, but Mice, Lizards, Beetles, &amp;c.

## The Turkey Buzzard.

This Bird weighs four pounds and a half. The Head and part of the Neck red, bald and fleshy, like that of a Turky, beset thinly with black hairs; the Bill two inches and a half long, half coverÕd with flesh; the end white, and hooked, like that of a Hawk, but without angles on the sides of the upper mandible. The Nostrils are remarkably large and open, situate at an unusual distance from the eyes: the Feathers of the whole body have a mixture of brown purple and green; the Legs short, of a flesh colour: their Toes are long-shaped, like those of Dunghil-fowls; their Claws black, and not so hooked as those of Hawks.

Their Food is Carrion; in search after which they are always soaring in the air. They continue a long time on the wing, and with an easy swimming motion mount and fall, without any visible motion of their wings. A dead carcass will attract together great numbers of them; and Õtis pleasant to observe their contentions in feeding. An Eagle sometimes presides at the Banquet, and makes them keep their distance while he satiates himself.

These birds have a wonderful sagacity in smelling: no sooner there is a beast dead, but they are seen approaching from all quarters of the air, wheeling about, and gradually descending and drawing nigh their prey, till at length they fall upon it. They are generally thought not to prey on any thing living, thoÕ I have known them kill Lambs; and Snakes are their usual food. Their custom is, to roost, many of them together, on tall dead Pine or Cypres-trees, and in the morning continue several hours on their roost, with their sings spread open: that the air, as I believe, may have the greater influence to purify their filthy carcasses. They are little apprehensive of danger, and will suffer a near approach, especially when they are eating.

# 7

## Noctua Aurita Minor: The Little Owl.

Is about the size of, or rather less than a Jack-daw; has large pointed Ears; the Bill small, the Iris of the Eye of a deep yellow, or Saffron-colour; the Feathers of its Face white, with a mixture of reddish brown: the Head and upper part of the Body of a fulvous or reddish brown colour: the Wings are of the same colour, except that they are verged about with white, have some white spots on the Quill-feathers, and five larger white spots on the upper part of each wing: the Breast and Belly is dusky white, intermixÕd with reddish brown feathers: the Tail dark-brown, a little longer than the wings: the Legs and Feet light brown, featherÕd and hairy down to the toes, armed with four semicircular black Tallons.

The Hen is of a deeper brown, without any tincture of red.

# 8 

## Caprimulgus: The Goat-Sucker of Carolina

This Bird agrees with the description of that in Mr. _Willoughby_, p. 107. of the same name, except that this is somewhat less. They are very numerous in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, and are called there _East_ _India_ Bats. In the evening they appear most, and especially in cloudy weather: before rain, the air is full of them, pursuing and dodging after Flies and Beetles. Their Note is only a screep; but by their precipitating and swiftly mounting again to recover themselves from the ground, they make a hollow and surprizing noise; which to Strangers is very observable, especially at dusk of the evening, when the chause is not to be seen. This noise is like that made by the wind blowing into a hollow vessel; wherefore I conceive it is occasionÕd by their wide mouth forcibly opposing the air, when they swiftly pursue and catch their prey, which are Flies, Beetles, &amp;c.

They usually lay two eggs, like in shape, size and colour to those of Lapwings, and on the bare ground.

Its stomach was filled up with half-digested Scarabei, and other Insects; and amongst the remains there seemed to be the feet of the _Grillotalpa_, but so much consumed, that I could not be certain: they being both nocturnal Animals, makes the probability the greater. They disappear in winter.

The _Grillotalpa_ is found both in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, in th elike marshy grounds as in _England_, and seems not to differ from ours.

# 9

## Cuculus Caroliniensis: The Cuckow of _Carolina_.

Is about the size of a Black-bird: the Bill a little hooked and sharp; the upper Mandible black; the under, yellow: the large Wing-feathers reddish; the rest of the Wing, and all the upper part of the Body, Head and Neck, ash-colour: all the under part of the Body, from the Bill to the Tail, white: the Tail long and narrow, composed of six long and four shorter feathers; the two middlemost ash-colour, the rest black, with their ends white: their Legs short and strong, having two back-toes, and two before. Their Note is very different from ours, and not so remarkable as to be taken notice of. It is a solitary Bird, frequenting the darkest recesses of woods and shady thickets. They retire at the approach of winter.

## Castanea pumila Virginiana, fructu racemato parvo in singulis capsulis echinatis unico. D. Banister: The Chinkapin.

It is a Shrub which seldom grows higher than sixteen feet, and usually not above eight or ten: the Body commonly eight or ten inches thick, and irregular; the Bark rough and scaly; the Leaves are serrated, and grow alternately, of a dark green, their back-sides being of a greenish white: at the joints of the leaves shoot forth long spikes of whitish flowers, like those of the common Chesnut, which are succeeded by Nuts of a conic shape, and the size of a Hasel-nut; the Shell, which incloses the Kernel, is of the colour and consistence of that of a Chesnut, inclosed in a prickly burr, usually five or six hanging in a cluster. They are ripe in _September_.

These Nuts are sweet, and more pleasant than the Chesnut; of great use to the _Indians_, who for their Winter's provision lay them up in store.

# 10

## Psittacus Paradisi ex Cuba: The Parrot of Paradise of Cuba.

Is somewhat less than the common _African_ grey Parrot: the Bill white, the Eyes red: the upper-part of the Head, Neck, Back and Wings, of a bright yellow, except he Quill-feathers of the Wing, which are white: the Neck and Breast scarlet; below which is a wide space of yellow; the remainder of the under-part of the Body scarlet; half way of the under-part of the Tail, next the Rump, red, the rest yellow. All the yellow, particularly the Back and Rump, have the ends of the feathers tinged with red: the Feet and Claws white. The figure of this Bird has the disadvantage of all the rest, it being painted only from the Case: for as all different Birds have gestures peculiar to them, it is requisite they should be drawn from the living Birds, otherwise it is impracticable to give them their natural air; which method, except in a few Birds, has been practisÕd through the whole Collection. It was shot by an _Indian_, on the Island _Cuba_; and being only disabled from flying, he carried it to a Gentlewoman of _Carolina_, with whom it livÕd some Years, much admired for its uncommonness and beauty.

## Frutex Lauri folio pendulo, fructu tricocco, semine nigro splendente: Red-Wood.

This Tree usually grows from sixteen to twenty foot high, with a small Trunk, and slender Branches; the Leaves shaped not unlike those of the Bay-tree; three black Seeds are contained in every capsule: the Bark of a russet colour, and smooth: the Grain of a fine red; but being exposed a little time to the air, fades, and loses much of its lustre. They grow plentifully on the Rocks in most of the _Bahama_ Islands.

# 11

## Psitticus Caroliniensis: The Parrot of _Carolina_.

This Bird is of the bigness, or rather less than a Black-bird, weighing three ounces and a half: the fore-part of the Head Orange-colour; the hind-part of the Head and Neck yellow. All the rest of the Bird appears green; but, upon nearer scrutiny, the interior vanes of most of the wing-feathers are dark-brown: the upper-parts of the exterior vanes of the larger Wing or Quill-feathers, are yellow, proceeding gradually deeper colourÕd to the end, from yellow to green, and from green to blue: the edge of the Shoulder of the Wing, for about three inches down, is bright Orange-colour. The Wings are very long, as is the Tail; having the two middle-feathers longer than the others by an inch and a half, and end in a point; the rest are gradually shorter. The Legs and Feet are white: the small Feathers covering the Thighs, are green, ending at the Knees with a verge of Orange-colour. They feed on Seeds and Kernels of Fruit; particularly those of Cypress and Apples. The Orchards in Autumn are visited by numerous flights of them; where they make great destruction for their Kernels only: for the same purpose they frequent _Virginia_; which is the furthest North I ever heard they have been seen. Their Guts are certain and speedy poison to Cats. This is the only one of the Parrot kind in _Carolina_: some of them breed in the Country; but most of 'em retire more South.

## The Cypress of _America_.

The Cypress (except the Tulip-tree) is the tallest and largest in these parts of the world. Near the ground some of 'em measure 30 foot in circumference, rising pyramidally six foot, where it is about two thirds less; from which to the limbs, which is usually 60 or 70 foot, it grows in like proportion of other trees. Four or five foot round this Tree (in a singular manner) rise many Stumps, some a little above ground, and others from one to four foot high, of various shape and size, their tops round, coverÕd with a smooth red Bark. These Stumps shoot from the roots of the Tree, yet they produce neither Leaf nor Branch, the Tree increasing only by seed, which in form are like the common Cypress, and contain a balsamic consistence of a fragrant smell. The Timber this Tree affords, is excellent, and particularly for covering Houses with, it being light, of a free Grain, and resisting the Injuries of the weather better than any other here. It is an Aquatic, and usually rows from one, five and six foot deep in water; which secure situation seems to invite a great number of different Birds to breed in its lofty branches; monist which this Parrot delights to make its Nest, and in _October_, (at which time the Seed is ripe) to feed on their Kernels.

# 12

## Mondela Purpurea: The Purple Jack-Daw.

This is not so big by one third part as the common Jack-Daw, weighing six ounces: the Bill black; the Eyes gray; the Tail long, the Middle-feathers longest, the rest gradually shorter. At a distance they seem all black, but at a nearer view, they appear purple, particularly the Head and Neck has most lustre: The Hen is all over brown, the Wing, Back and Tail being darkest. They make their Nest on the branches of trees in all parts of the country, but most in remote and unfrequented places; from whence in Autumn, after a vast increase, they assemble together, and come amongst the Inhabitants in such numbers that they sometimes darken the air, and are seen in continued flights for miles together, making great devastation of grain where they light. In winter they flock to barn-doors.	 They have a rank smell; their flesh is course, black, and is seldom eat.

# 13

## Sturnus niger alis superne rubentibus: The red-wing'd starling.

A Cock weighed between three and four ounces, in shape and size resembling our Starling. The whole Bird (except the upper part of the Wings) is black, and would have little beauty, were it not for the Shoulders of the wings, which are bright scarlet. This and the Purple-Daw are of the same Genus, and are most voracious corn-eaters. They seem combined to do all the mischief they are able: and, to make themselves most formidable, both kinds unite in one flock, and are always together, except its breeding-time, committing their devastations all over the Country. When they are shot, there usually falls of both kinds; and before one can load again, there will be in the same place oft-times more than before they were shot at. They are the boldest and most destructive Birds in the Country. This seems to be the Bird _Hernandez_ calls Acolchichi, _Will. Orn. p._ 391. They make their Nests in _Carolina_ and _Virginia_ not on trees, but always over the water, amongst reeds or sedge; the tops of which they interweave very artfully, and under fix their Nests; and to secure from wet, that where the Tides flow, it is observed never to reach them. They are familiar and active Birds, and are taught to talk and sing.

The Hens are considerably less than the Cocks, of a mixed gray, and the red on their Wings not so bright.

## Myrtus Brabanticae similis Caroliniensis humilior; foliis latioribus & magis ferratis: The broad-leaved Candle-berry Myrtle.

This grows usually not above three foot high; in which, and its having a broader leaf than the tall Candle-berry Myrtle, it principally differs from it.

# 14

## Hortulanus Caroliniensis: The Rice-Bird.

In the beginning of _September_, while the Grain of Rice is yet soft and milky, innumerable Flights of these Birds arrive from some remote Parts, to the great detriment of the inhabitants. _Anno_ 1724, an Inhabitant near _Ashley_ river had forty acres of Rice devoured by them, that he was in doubt, whether what they had left, was worth the expence of gathering in.

They are esteemed in _Carolina_ the greatest delicacy of all other Birds. When they first arrive, they are lean, but in few days become so excessive fat, that they fly sluggishly and with difficulty; and when shot, frequently break with the fall. They continue about three weeks, and retire by that time Rice begins to harden.

There is somewhat so singular and extraordinary in this Bird, that I cannot pass it over without notice. In _September_, when they arrive in infinite swarms, to devour the Rice, they are all Hens, not being accompanied with any Cock. Observing them to be all feather'd alike, I imagin'd they were young of both sexes, not perfected in their colours; but by opening some scores prepared for the spit, I found them to be all Females; and that I might leave no room for doubt, repeated the search often on many of them, but could never find a Cock at that time of the year.

Early in the Spring, both Cocks and Hens make a transient visit together, at which time I made the like search as before, and both sexes were plainly distinguishable. The Hen, which is properly the Rice-Bird, is about the bigness of a Lark, and colour'd not unlike it on the Back; the Breast and Belly pale-yellow, the Bill, strong sharp-pointed, and shap'd like most others of the graniverous kind. This seems to be the Bird describ'd by the name of Maja, _Will. App. p._ 386. In _September_ 1725. lying upon the deck of a Sloop in a Bay at _Andros_ Island, I and the Company with me heard, three nights succesively, Flights of these Birds (their Note being plainly distinguishable from others) passing over our heads northerly, which is their direct way from _Cuba_ to _Carolina_; from which I conceive, after partaking of the earlier crop of Rice at _Cuba_, they travel over sea to _Carolina_, for the same intent, the Rice there being, at that time fit for them.

The Cock's Bill is lead-colour, the forepart of the Head black, the hind-part and the Neck of a reddish yellow, the upper-part of the Wing white, the Back next the Head black, lower down grey, the Rump white, the greatest part of the Wing, and whole Tail, black, the Legs and Feet brown in both sexes.

# 15

Pica glandaria caerulea cristata: The Blue Jay.

Is full as big, or bigger than Starling: the Bill black; above the Basis of the upper Mandible are black Feathers, which run in a narrow stripe cross the Eyes, meeting a broad black stripe, which encompasses the Head and Throat: its Crown-feathers are long, which it erects at pleasure: the Back of a dusky purple: the interior vanes of the larger Quill-feathers black; the exterior, blue, with transverse black lines cross every feather, and their ends tipt with white: the Tail blue, mark'd with the like cross-lines as on the Wings. They have the like jetting motion of our Jay; their Cry is more tuneful.

The Hen is not so bright in colour, except which there appears no difference.


## Smilax laevis Lauri folio baccis nigris: The BAY-LEAVED SMILAX.

This Plant is usually found in moist places: it sends forth from its root many green Stems, whose Branches overspread whatsoever stands near it, to a very considerable distance; and it frequently climbs above sixteen foot in height, growing so very thick, that in Summer it makes an impenetrable Shade, and in Winter a warm shelter for Cattle. The Leaves are of the colour and consistence of Laurel, but in shape more like the Bay, without any visible veins, the middle-rib only excepted.

The Flowers are small and whitish; the Fruit grows in round Clusters and is a black Berry, containing one single hard Seed, which is ripe in October, and is food for some sorts of Birds, particularly this Jay.

# 16

## Picus Maximus rostro albo: The largest white-bill Wood-pecker.
Weighs twenty ounces; about the size, or somewhat larger than a Crow. The Bill white as Ivory, three inches long, and channelled from the basis to the point: the Iris of the eye yellow: the hind-part of the Head adorned with a large peaked crest of scarlet feathers: a crooked white Stripe runs from the eye on each side the Neck, towards the Wing: the lower part of the Back and Wings (except the large Quill-feathers) are white, all the rest of the Bird is black.

The Bills of these Birds are much valued by the _Canada Indians_, who make Coronets of 'em for their Princes and great warriers, by fixing them round a Wreath, with their points outward. The _Northern Indians_ having none of these Birds in their cold country, purchase them of the Southern People at the price of two, and sometimes three Buck-shins a Bill.

These Birds subsist chiefly on Ants, Wood-worms, and other Insects, which they hew out of rotten trees; nature having so formed their Bills, that in an hour or two's time they will raise a bushel of chips; for which the _Spaniards_ call 'em _Carpenteros_.

## Quercus, an potius Ilex Marilandica folio longo angusto Salicus. Raii Hist: The Willow-Oak.

This Oak is never found but in low moist land; the Leaves are long, narrow and smooth-edged, in shape like the Willow: the wood is soft and course-grained, and of less use than most of the other kinds of Oak. In mild Winters they retain their Leaves in _Carolina_; but in _Virginia_ they drop.

# 17

## PICUS niger maximus capite rubro: The larger red-crested Wood-pecker.

Weighs nine ounces: the Bill angular two inches long, of a lead colour: the Neck is small; the Iris of the eye gold colour, encompassed with a lead-colour'd skin: the whole Crown of the Head is adorn'd with large scarlet crest; under which, and from the eyes back, runs a narrow white line, and under that a broad black lift: a patch of red covers some of the lower mandible of the Bill and Neck; the rest of the Neck (except the hind-part, which is black) of a pale yellow, with a small stripe of black dividing it: the upper part of the exterior vanes of the Quill-feathers is white; above which, on the edge of the Wing, is a white spot or two: on the middle of the Back is a broad white spot all the rest of the upper part of the Body and Tail black: the under part of the Body of a dusky black.

That which distinguishes the Cock from the Hen, is the red which covers some part of his under jaw, which in the Hen is black. And whereas the whole Crown of the Cock is red, in the Hen the Fore-head is brown. These Birds (besides Insects, which they get from rotten trees, their usual food) are destructive to Maiz, by pecking Holes through the husks that inclose the grain, and letting in wet.


## Quercus sempervivens foliis oblongis non sinuatis. D. Banister: The Live Oak.

The usual Height of the Live Oak is about 40 foot; the Grain of the wood course, harder and tougher than any other Oak. Upon the edges of Salt-Marshes (where they usually grow) they arrive to a large size. Their Bodies are irregular, and generally lying along, occasioned by the looseness and moisture of the soil, and tides washing their roots bare. On higher lands they grow erect, with a regular pyramidal-shaped Head, retaining their leaves all the year. The Acorns are the sweetest of all others; of which the _Indians_ usually lay up store, to thicken their venison-soop, and prepare them other ways. They likewise draw an oil, very pleasant and wholesom, little inferior to that of Almonds.

# 18

## PICUS major alis aureis: The Gold-winged Wood-pecker.

This Bird weighs five ounces: the Bill black, an inch and half long, and a little bending: from the angles of the Mouth on each side runs down a broad black lift, about an inch long: the upper part of the Head and Neck of a lead-colour. On the hind part of the Head is a large scarlet spot. On the hind part of the Neck, Throat, and about the Eyes, of a bay colour; the Back, and part of the Wing next to it, is intermix'd with black spots, in form of half moons. The larger Wing-Feathers brown. What adds to the elegancy of this bird, and what alone is sufficient to distinguish it by, is, that the beams of all the Wing-Feathers are of a bright gold-colour. The Breast has in the middle of it a large black spot, in form of a crescent, from which to it's vent it is dusky white, and spotted with round and some heart-shaped black spots. The Rump white, the Tail black, which, with the Feet, are formed as others of this kind. It differs from other Wood-peckers in the hookedness of it's Bill, and manner of feeding, which is usually on the ground, out of which it draws worms and other insects; neither do they alight on the bodies of trees in an erect posture as Wood-peckers usually do, but like other Birds.

The Hen wants the black lift, which is at the Throat of the Cock, except which, she differs from him not in colour.

## Quercus castaneae foliis, procera arbor virginiana: The Chestnut Oak.

This Oak grows only in low and very good land, and is the tallest and largest of the Oaks in these parts of the World: the Bark white and scaly; the Grain of the Wood not fine, though the Timber is of great use: the Leaves are large, indented round the edges, like those of the Chesnut. None of the other Oaks produce so large Acorns.

# 19

## Pica Ventre rubro: The Red-bellied Wood-pecker.

Weighs two ounces six penny weight: the Bill black; the Eyes of a hazel colour; all the upper part of the Head and Neck bright red; below which it is Ash colour, as is the under part of the Body, except the Belly, near the Vent, which is stained with red: the upper part of the Body, including the Wings, is marked regularly with transverse black and white lines: the Tail black and white; the Feet black.

The Hen's Fore-head is brown; which is all the difference between them.

## PICUS medius quasi villosus: The Hairy Wood-pecker.

Weighs two ounces: the Crown of the Head black; a red spot covers the back part of the Head, between which and the Eye it is white; the rest of the Head and Neck black, with a white line in the middle; the Back is black, with a broad white stripe of hairy feathers, extending down the middle to the Rump; the Wings are black, with both vanes of the Feathers spotted with large white spots: the Tail black; all the under part of the Body white.

The Hen differs from the Cock, only in not haveing the red spot at the Back of the Head.


### Quercus (forte) Marilandica, folia trifido ad sassafras accedente. Raii Hist: The Black Oak.

Usually grows on the poorest land, and is small: the colour of the Bark black, the Grain course: and the Wood of little use but to burn: Some of these Oaks produce Leaves ten inches wide.

# 20

## Picus Capite toto rubro: The Red-headed Wood-pecker.

This bird weighs two ounces, the Bill sharp, somewhat compressed sideways, of a lead colour: the whole Head and Neck deep red: the under part of the Body and Rump white; as are the smaller Wing-feathers; which, when the Wings are closed, join to the the white on the Rump, and make a broad white patch cross the lower part of the back; the upper part of which is black, as are the Quill-feathers and Tail, which is short and stiff. In _Virginia_ very few of these Birds are to be seen in winter: in _Carolina_ there are more, but not so numerous as in summer; wherefore I conceive they retire Southward, to avoid the cold. This is the only one of the Wood-peckers that may be termed domestick, frequenting Villages and Plantations, and takes a peculiar delight in ratling with its Bill on the boarded houses. They are great devourers of fruit and grain.

The Hen in colour differs little or nothing from the Cock.


## Quercus folio non serrato, in summitate quasi triangulo: The Water-Oak.

These grow no where but in low waterish lands: the Timber not durable, therefore of little use, except for fencing in fields. In mild winters they retain most of their leaves. Their Acorns are small and bitter, and are rejected by the hogs while others are to be found.

# 21

## Picus Various Minor, Ventre Luteo: The yellow belly'd Wood-pecker.

Weighs one ounce thirteen penny weight. Its Bill is of a lead colour; all the upper part of the Head is red, bordered below with a lift of black under which runs a lift of white, parallel with which runs a black lift from the Eyes to the back of the Head, under which it is pale yellow: The throat is red and bordered round with black: On the Neck and Back the feathers are black and white, with a tincture of greenish yellow: The Breast and Belly are of a light yellow, with some black feathers intermix'd: The Wings are black, except towards the shoulders where there are some white feathers; and both edges of the Quill-feathers are spotted with White: the Tail is black and white.

The Hen is distinguishable by not having any red about her.


## Picus Varius Minimus: _The Smallest Spotted Wood-pecker_.

Weighs fourteen penny-weight. It so nearly resmbles the Hairy Wood-pecker, _Tab_. 19. in its marks and colour, that were it not for disparity of size, they might be thought to be the same. The Breast and Belly of this are light gray: The four uppermost feathers of the Tail are black: the rest are gradually shorter, and transversely marked with Black and White: The Legs and Feet are black. Thus far this differs from the description of the above mentioned.

The Hen differs from the Cock in nothing but wanting the red spot on its Head.


### Quercus alba Virginiana, Park; The White Oak.

This nearest resembles our common English Oak in the shape of its Leaves, Acorns, and Manner of growing; the Bark is White, the grain of the Wood fine, for which and its durableness it is esteem'd the best Oak in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_. It grows on all kind of Land; but most on high barren Ground amongst Pine Trees.

There is another kind of white Oak, which in _Virginia_ is called the _Scaly white Oak_, with Leaves like this, the Bark white and scaly, the Wood is of great use in building. They grow on rich Land both high and low.


#### Quercus Carolinensis virentibus venis muricata: The White Oak, with pointed Notches.

The leaves of this Oak are notched and have sharp points. The Bark and Wood is white, but has not so close a grain as the precedent. Dr. Pluknet has figured a leaf shaped like this by the Name of _Quercus Virginiana rubris venis muricata_. This has no red Veins. Vide _Pluk. Phytograph. Tab_. LIV. _fig. 5_.

#### _Syringa Baccifera_, Myrti subrotundis foliis, floribus albis gemellis ex provincia Floridana.

This plant grows in moist Places, usually under trees, on which it sometimes creeps a little way up, but most commonly trails on the Ground, many Stems rising close together near the Ground, about six inches long, which have some side Branches: the Leaves are small, in form of a heart, and grow opposite to each other on very small foot-stalks: it's Flowers are tetrapetalous, very small, and in form and colour like those of the white Lilach, and are succeeded by red berries of an Oval form and of the size of large peas, having two small holes, and contain many small Seeds. It retains the leaves all the Year.

## Sitta Capite Nigro: The Nuthatch.

Weighs 13 Penny-weight, 5 graines. The Bill and upper part of the Head and Neck black, the Back gray: The Wings of a dark brown, edg'd with light gray; the uppermost two Feathers of the Tail are gray; the rest black and white. At the vent is a reddish Spot, the Legs and Feet are brown. The back claw is remarkably bigger and longer than the rest, which seems necessary to support their body in creeping down as well as up Trees, in which action they are usually seen pecking their food (which are Infects) from the chinks or crevices of the Bark.

The Hen differs but little from the Cock in the colour of her feathers. They breed and continue the whole year in _Carolina_.


## Sitta Capite Fusco: _The Small Nuthatch_.

This weighs six Penny-weight; the Bill black; the upper part of the Head brown; behind which is a dusky white spot; the Back is gray; as are the two uppermost tail feathers; the rest being black; the Wings are dark brown; the Throat and all the under part of the Body dusky white; the tail is short; the back Toe is largest. They abide all the Year in _Carolina_. Their Food, and Manner of taking it, is the same as that of the larger _Nuthatch_.


### Quercus humilior salicis folio breviore: The Highland Willow Oak.

This is usually a small Tree, having a dark coloured Bark with leaves of a pale green, and shaped like those of a Willow. It grows on dry poor land, producing but few Acorns, and those small. Most of these Oaks are growing at Mr. _Fairchild's_.

# 23

## Palumbus Migratorius: The Pigeon of Passage.

It is about the size of our English Wood-Pigeon; the Bill black; the iris of the Eye red; the Head dusky blew; the breast and belly faint red. Above the shoulder of the Wing is a patch of feathers that shines like Gold; the wing colour'd like the head, having some few spots of black, (except that the larger feathers of it are dark brown) with some white on their exterior vanes. The Tail is very long, covered with a black Feather; under wich the rest are white; the Legs and Feet red.

Of these there come in Winter to _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, from the North, incredible Numbers; insomuch that in some places where they roost (which they do on one another's Backs) they often break down the limbs of Oaks with their weight, and leave their Dung some Inches thick under the Trees they roost on. Where they light, they so effectually clear the Woods of Acorns and other Mast, that the Hogs that come after them, to the detriment of the Planters, fare very poorly. In _Virginia_ I have seen them fly in such continued trains three days successively, that there was not the least interval in losing sight of them, but that some where or other in the Air they were to be seen continuing their flight South. In mild Winters there are few or none to be seen. A hard Winter drives them South for the greater plenty and variety of Mast, Berries, _&c_. which they are deprived of in the North by continual Frost and Snow.

In their passage the People of _New York_ and _Philadelphia_ shoot many of them as they fly, from their Balconies and Tops of Houses; and in _New England_ there are such Numbers, that with long Poles they knock them down from their Roosts in the Night in great numbers. The only information I have had from whence they come, and their placers of breeding, was from a _Canada Indian_, who told me he had seen them make their Nests in Rocks by the sides of Rivers and Lakes far North of the River _St. Lawrence_, where he said he shot them. It is remarkable that none are ever seen to return, at least this way, and what other Rout they may take is unknown.


## Quercus Esculi divisura foliis amplioribus aculeatis: The Red Oak.

The Leaves of this Oak retain no certain form; but sport into various shapes more than other Oaks do. The Bark is dark colour'd, very thick and strong, and for tanning preferable to any other kind of Oak; the grain is course, the wood spongy, and not durable. They grow on high land: the Acorns vary in shape, as appears by the figures of them; they being from the ame kind of oak.

# 24

## Turtur Carolinensis: The Turtle of Carolina.

This is somewhat less than a Dove-house Pigeon: the Eyes black, compassed with a blew Skin: the Bill black: the upper part of the Head, Neck, Back, and upper part of the Wings brown: the small feathers of the Wing, next the Back, have large black spots: the lower part of the Wing and Quill-feathers of a lead colour, three or four of the longest being almost black: The Breast and Belly of a pale Carnation colour. On each side the Neck, the breadth of a Man's Thumb, are two spots of the colour of burnished Gold, with a tincture of crimson and green; between which and its Eye is a black spot. The Wings are long, the Tail much longer, reaching almost five Inches beyond them, and hath fourteen feathers, the two middle longest, and of equal length, and all brown; the rest are gradually shorter, having their upper part lead colour, the middle black, and the end white. The Legs and Feet are red. They breed in _Carolina_, and abide there always. They feed much on the Berries of Poke, i. e. _Blitum Virginianum_, which are Poison. They likewise feed on the Seeds of this Plant; and they are accounted good Meat.


_Anapodophyllon Canadense Merini_. Turnef. Ranunculi facie planta peregrina H. R. Par. Aconitisolia humilis, flore albo, unico campanulato Fructu Cynosbati. _Mentz. Tab. 11. Turnef. Inst. p._ 239: The May Apple.

This Plant grows about a Foot and half high; the Flower consisting of several _Petala_, with many yellow _Stamina_ sourrunding the seed-vessel, which is oval, _unicapsular_, and contains many roundish Seeds. The Leaves of the Plant resemble the _Aconitum lycoctonum luteum C.B. Pin_. The Root is said to be an excellent Emetic, and is used as such in _Carolina_; which has given it there the Name of _Ipecacuana_, the stringy Roots of which it resembles. It flowers in _March_; the Fruit is ripe in _May_; which has occasioned it in _Virginia_ to be called _May-Apple_.

# 25

## Columba Capite Albo: The White-crown'd Pigeon.

It is as big as the common tame Pigeon. The Basis of the Bill is purple; the end dusky white; the Iris of the Eye yellow, with a dusky white Skin round it. The Crown of the Head is white; below which it is purple. The Hind-part of the Neck is covered with changeable shining green Feathers, edged with black. All the rest of the Bird is of a dusky blew, the Legs and Feet are red. They breed in great Numbers on all the _Bahama-Islands_, and are of great advantage to the Inhabitants, particularly while young. They are taken in great quantities from off the Rocks on which they breed.


## Frutex Cotini fere folio crasso, in summitate deliquium patiente, fructu ovali caeruleo ossiculum angulosom continente: The Cocoa Plum.

This is a Shrub, which grows from Five to Ten Feet high; not with a single Trunc, but with several small Stems rising from the Ground, they growing many together in Thickets. The Flowers grow in Bunches, are small and white, with many _Stamina_. They produce a Succession of Fruit most part of the Summer, which is of the Size and Shape of a large Damasin; most of them blue: Some Trees produce pale yellow, and some red. Each Plumb contains a Stone shaped like a Pear, chanulated with six Ridges. They grow usually in low moist Ground near the Sea-side. The Leaves are as broad as a Crown, thick, stiff, and shaped somewhat like a Heart. The Fruit is esteemed vholesome, and hath a sweet lucious Taste. The _Spaniards_ at _Cuba_ make a Conserve of them, by preserving them in Sugar.

# 26

## Turtur Minimus Guttatus: The Ground-Dove.

The weight of this Dove was an ounce and half: In size about the same as a Lark. The Bill is yellow, except the end, which is black. The iris of the Eye red. The Breast and whole Front of the Bird is of a changeable pourple colour, with dark purple spots. The large Quill-Feathers and Tail are of a muddy purple. The Legs and Feet dirty yellow. In short, the whole Bird has such a Conpostion of Colours, so blended together, that no perfect description by words can he given of it. And I have observed some of them to differ in colour from others: from which Causes probably may be the reason why _Nieremberg_, _Margravius_, and others who have described it, have varied in their descriptions of it. They fly many of them together, and make short flights from place to place, lighting generally on the ground. They are natives of most Countries in _America_ lying between the Tropics. They sometimes approach so far North as _Carolina_, and visit the lower parts of the Country near the Sea, where these Trees grow, and feed on the Berries, which gives their flesh an Aromatic flavour.


## Zanthoxylum Spinosum, Lentisci, longioribus foliis Euonimi fructu capsulari ea Insula; Jamaicensi. D. Banister: The Pellitory, or Tooth-ach Tree.

This Tree seldom grows above a Foot in thickness, and about sixteen feet high. The Bark is white, and very rough. The Trunk and large Limbs are in a singular manner thick set, with pyramidal-shaped protuberances, pointing from the Tree; at the end of every one of which is a sharp thorn. These protuberances are of the same consistence with the Bark of the Tree, of various sizes, the largest being as big as Walnuts: The smaller Branches are beset with prikles only. The leaves are pennated, standing on a Rib six inches long, to which the Lobes are set one against another, with foot-stalks half an Inch long. The Lobes are awry their greatest Vein not running in the middle, but on one side, being bigger than the other. From the ends of the Branches shoot forth long stalks of small Pentapetalous white Flowers with reddish _Stamina_. Every flower is succeeded by four shining black Seeds, contained in a round green _capsula_. The leaves smell like those of Orange; which, with the Seeds and Bark is aromatic, very hot and astringent, and is used by the People inhabiting the Sea Coasts of _Virginia_ and _Carolina_ for the Tooth-ach, which has given it its name.

# 27

## Turdus Minor Cinereo-Albus Non Maculatus: The Mock-Bird.

This Bird is about as big or rather less than a Blackbird, and of a slenderer Make. The Bill is black; the Iris of the Eye of a brownish yellow; the Back and Tail dark-brown; the Breast and Belly light-gray; the Wings brown, except that the upper part of the Quill-feathers have their exterior Vanes white; and some of the small feathers, near the shoulder of the Wing, are verged with white. The Cocks and Hens are so like that they are not easily distinguished by the colour of their feathers.

_Herandez_ justly calls it the Queen of all singing Birds. The _Indians_, by way of eminence or admiration, call it _Cencontlatolly_, or _four hundred tongues_; and we call it (tho' not by so elevated a name, yet very properly) the _Mock-bird_, from its wonderful mocking and imitating the notes of all Birds, from the Humming Bird to the Eagle. From _March_ till _August_ it sings incessantly day and night with the greatest variety of Notes; and, to compleat his compositions, borrows from the whole Choir, and repeats tho them their own Tunes with such artful Melody, that it is equally pleasing and surprising. They may be said not only to sing but dance, by grandually raising themselves from the place where they stand, with their Wings extended, and falling with their Head down to the same place; then turning round, with their Wings continuing spread, have many pretty antic Gesticulations with their Melody.

They are familiar and sociable Birds, usually pearching on the tops of Chimneys or Trees, amongst, the Inhabitans, who are diverted with their tuneful Airs most part of the Summer. Their food are Haws, Berries and Insects. In winter, when there is less variety and plenty, they will eat the berries of Dogwood.


## Cornus mas Virginiana flosculis in corymbo digestis perianthio titrapetalo albo: The Dogwood Tree.

This is a small Tree, the Trunc being seldom above eight or ten Inches thick. The Leaves resemble our common Dogwood, but are fairer and larger, standing opposite to each other on foot-stalks of about an Inch long, from among which branch forth many Flowers in the fallowing manner. In the beginning of _March_ the blossoms break forth; and though perfectly formed and wide open, are not so wide as a Six-pence; increasing gradually to the breadth of a Man's hand, being not at their full bigness till about six Weeks after they began to open. Each Flower consists of four greenish white Leaves, every leaf having a deep indenture at the end. From the bottom of the Flower rises a tuft of yellow _Stamina_; every one of which opens a-top into four small Leaves or Petals: The Wood is white, has a close grain, and very hard like that of Boxe. The Flowers are succeded by clusters of Berries, having from two to six in a cluster, closely joyned, and set on food-stalks an inch long. These berries are red, of an oval form, and of the size of large Haws, containing a hard stone. As the Flowers are a great Ornament to the Woods in Summer, so are the Berries in Winter, they remaining full on the Trees usually till the approach of Spring: and being very bitter are little coveted by Birds, except in time of Dearth. I have observed Mock-birds and other kinds of Thrushes to feed on them. In _Virginia_ I found one of these Dogwood trees with Flowers of a rose-colour, which was luckily blown down, and many of its Branches had taken Root, which I transplanted into a Garden. That with the white flower Mr. _Fairchild_ has in his Garden.

# 28

## Turdus Ruffus: The Fox Coloured Thrush.

This is somewhat larger than the Mock-Bird, and of a more clumsy shape. Its Bill somewhat long, and a little hooked. The Eyes yellow. All the upper part of its Body of a muddy red, or Fox-colour, except the interior vanes of the Quill-Feathers which are dark-brown, and the ends of the covert Wing-Feathers which are edged with dusky White. Its Tail is very long, and of the same colour of the Back and Wings. The Neck, Breast, and all the under part of the Body, of a dusky white, spotted with dark-brown. The Legs and Feet are brown. This Bird is called in _Virginia_ the _French Mock-Bird_. It remains all the year in _Carolina_ and _Virginia_. It sings with some variety of Notes, though not comparable to the Mock-Bird.


## Cerasi Similis arbuscula Marina. Paedi folio, flore alba parvo racemoso, Plek: The ClusterÕd Black Cherry.

This Tree, in the Manner of its growing, resembles much our common black Cherry, in the thick Woods of _Carolina_, where these Trees most abound. They seldom grow bigger than a Man's leg; but by being removed to more open Places, they become large, some of them being two Feet in Diameter. In _March_ it produces pendulous Bunches of white flowers which are succeded by small black Cherries of a greenish Cast, hanging in Clusters of five inches long, in the manner of Currants. The Fruit of some of these Trees is sweet and pleasant: Others are bitter. They are esteemed for making the best Cherry Brandy of any other, and also for stoks to graft other Cherries upon. They are much coveted by Birds, particularly those of the Thrushkind.

# 29

## Turdus Pilaris, Migratorius: The Fieldfare of _Carolina_.

Weighs two ounces, three quarters; about the size and shape of the _European_ Field fare. That part of the Bill, next the Head, is yellow. Over and under the Eye are two white streaks. The upper part of the Head is black, with a mixture of Brown. The Wings and upper part of the Body brown: The Tail dark-brown: The Throat black and white: The Breast and Belly red: The Legs and Feet brown. In Winter they arrive from the North in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, in numerous Flights, and return in the Spring as ours in _England_. They are canorous, having a loud Cry like our Missel-bird, which the following Accident gave me an opportunity of knowing: Having some Trees of _Alaternus_ full of Berries (which were the first that had been introduced in _Virginia_) a single Feildfare seemed so delighted with the Berries, that he tarried all the Summer feeding on them. In _Maryland_, I am told, they breed and abide the whole year.


## Aristolochia pistolochia Seu Serpentaria Virginiana caule nodoso: The Snake-Root of Virginia.

This Plant rises out of the Ground in one, two, and sometimes three pliant Stalks, which at every little distance are crooked, or undulated.	 The Leaves stand alternately, and are about three inches long, in form somewhat like the _Smilax aspera_. The Flowers grow close to the ground on foot-stalks an inch long, of a singular shape, though somewhath resembling those of the Birthworts, of a dark purple colour. A round chanulated _capsula_ succeeds the Flower, containing many small Seeds, which are ripe in _May_. The usual price of this excellent Root, both in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, is about six pence a Pound when dried, which is Money hardly earned.	 Yet the Negro Slaves (who only dig it) employ much of the little time allowed them by their Masters in search of it; which is the Cause of there being seldom found any but very small Plants. By planting them in a Garden they increased so in two years time, that one's hand could not grasp the stalks of one Plant. It delights in shady woods, and is usually found at the Roots of great Trees.

# 30

## Turdus Viscivorus Plumbeus: The red-leg'd Thrush.

Weighs two ounces and an half; has a dusky black Bill: The inside of the Mouth is more red than usual: The Iris of the Eye red, with a circle of the same colour encompassing it: The Throat black: All the rest of the Body of a dusky blue, except that the interior Vanes of the large wing-feathers are black, as is the Tail when closed; but when spread, the outermost Feathers appear to have their Ends white, and are gradually shorter than the two middlemost: The Legs and Feet are red.

The Hen differs from the Cock no otherwise than in being about a third part less. In the Gizzard of one were the Berries of the Tree described below. In its Singing, Gestures, _&c_. this Bird much resembles other Thrushes. I saw many of them on the Islands of _Andros_ and _Ilathera_.

## Teribinthus major Batuloe cortice, fructu triangular: The Gum-Elimy Tree.

This is a large Tree; the Bark remarkably red and smooth. The Leaves are pennate; the middle rib five or six inches long, with the _Pinnoe_ set opposite to one another, on foot stalks half an inch long. The Blossoms (which I did not see) are succeeded by purple-coloured Berries bigger than large Peas, hanging in clusters on a stalk of about five inches long, to which each Berry is joined by a Foot-stalk of an inch long. The Seed is hard, white, and of a triangular figure, inclosed within a thin _capsula_, which divides in three parts, and discharges the Seed: This Tree produces a large quantity of Gum, of a brown colour, and of the Consistence of Turpentine. It is esteemed a good Vulnerary and is much used for Horses. Most of the _Bahama_ Islands abound with these Trees.

# 31

## Turdus Minimus: The Little Thrush.

In Shape and Colour it agrees with the Description of the _European Mavis_, or _Song Thrush_, differing only in Bigness: this weighing no more than one Ounce and a quarter. It never sings, having only a single Note, like the Winter-Note of our _Mavis_. It abides all the Year in _Carolina_. They are seldom seen, being but few, and those abiding only in dark Recesses of the thickest Woods and Swamps. Their Food is the Berries of Holly, Haws, _&c_.


## Agrifolium Carolinense foliis dentatis baccis rubris: The Dahoon Holly.

This Holly usually grows erect, sixteen Feet high; the Branches shooting straighter, and being of quicker Growth than the common Kind. The Leaves are longer, of a brighter green, and more pliant; not prickly, but serrated only. The Berries are red, growing in large Clusters. This is a very uncommon Plant in _Carolina_, I having never seen it but at Col. _Bull's_ Plantation on _Ashley_ River, where it grows in a Bog.

# 32

## Alauda Gutture Flavo: The Lark.

In size and shape this resembles our Sky-Lark. The Crown of the Head is mixt with black and yellow feathers. Through the Eyes runs a stripe of yellow. From the Angle of the Mouth runs a black stripe inclining downward; except which, the Throat and Neck are yellow. The upper part of the Breast is covered with a Patch of black feathers, in form of a Crescent. The remaining part of the Breast and Belly, of a brown straw-colour. It has a long Heel. It has a single Note, like that of our Sky Lark in Winter; at which time, and in cold Weather only, they appear in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_. They come from the North in great Flights, and return early in the Spring. From their near resemblance to our Sky-Lark, I conceive they mount up and sing as ours do; but they appearing here only in Winter, I cannot determine it. They frequent the Sand-Hills upon the Sea-shore of _Carolina_, and there feed on these Oats, which they find scattered on the Sands.


## Gramen Myloicophoron 0xyphyllon Carolinianum: The Sea-Side Oat.

This Plant I observed growing no where but on Sand-Hills; so near the Sea, that at high Tides the Water flows to it. Its Height is usually four and five feet.

# 33

## Alauda Magna: The Large Lark.

This Bird weighs three ounces and a quarter. The Bill is straight, sharp, and somewhat flat towards the End. Between the Eye and the Notril is a yellow Spot. The Crown of the Head is brown, with a dusky white lift running from the Bill along the middle of it. A black lift, of about an inch long, extends downwards from the Eye. The sides of the Head are light gray. The Wings and upper part of the Body are of a Partridge-coulour. The Breast has a large black Mark, in form of a horse-shoe; except which, the Throat and all the under part of the Body is yellow. It has a jetting Motion with its Tail, sitting on the tops of small Trees and Bushes in the manner of our Bunting; and, in the Spring, sings musically, though not many Notes. They feed mostly on the Ground on the seed of Grasses: Their flesh is good Meat. They inhabit _Carolina_, _Virginia_ and most of the Northern Continent of _America_.


## Ornithogalum luteum parvum foliis gramineis glabris: The Little Yellow Star-Flower.

This Plant grows usually not above five inches in height, producing many grassy leaves, from which rises a slender stalk bearing a yellow Star-like pentapetalous Flower. It has five _Stamina_, every leaf of the flower having one growing opposite to it. The Flower is succeeded by a small long _capsula_, containing many little black Seeds: This plant grows plentifully in most of the open Pasture lands in _Carolina_ and _Virginia_, where these Larks most frequent and feed on the Seed of it.

# 34

## Passer Niger, Oculis Rubris: The Towhe-bird.

This Bird is about the size of, or rather bigger than a Lark: The Bill black and thick: The iris of the Eye red: The Head, Neck, Breast, Back, and Tail, black; as are the Wings, with the larger Quill-Feathers edged with white. The lower part of the Breast and Belly white; which, on each side, is of a muddy red, extending along its Wings. The Legs and Feet are brown.


The Hen is brown, with a tincture of red on her Breast. It is a solitary Bird; and one seldom sees them but in Pairs. They breed and abide all the Year in _Carolina_ in the shadiest Woods.


## Passer Fusca: The Cowpen Bird.

This Bird is entirely brown, the Back being darkest, and the Breast and Belly the lightest part of it. In Winter they associate with the Red-wing'd Starling and Purple Jack-daw in Flights. They delight much to feed in the Pens of Cattle, which has given them their Name. Not having seen any of them in Summer, I believe they are Birds of Passage. They inhabit _Virginia_ and _Carolina_.


### Populus nigra maximo gemmis Balsamum odoratissimum fundentibus: The Black Poplar of Carolina.

This Tree grows only near Rivers, above the inhabited parts of _Carolina_. They are large and very tall. In _April_, at which time only I saw them, they had dropt their Seeds; which, by the Remains, I could only perceive to hang its Clusters, with a Cotton-like Consistence covering them. Upon the large swelling Buds of this Tree sticks a very odoriferous Balsam. The leaves are indented about the edges, and very broad, resembling in shape the Black Poplar, described by _Parkinson_.

# 35

## Passerculus: The Little Sparrow.

This Bird is entirely of a brown Colour; less than our Hedge-Sparrow, but partaking much of the nature of it. They are not numerous, being usually seen single, hopping under Bushes. They feed on Insects, and are seen most common near Houses in _Virgnia_ and _Carolina_, where they breed and abide the whole Year.


## Convolvulus Carolinensis angusto sagittato folio, flore amplissimo purpureo, radice crassa: The Purple Bind-Weed of Carolina.

The Flower of this _Convolvulus_ is of a reddish purple, and of the size and shape of common white Bind-weed. They blow in _June_. The Leaves are shaped like the head of an Arrow. Col: _Moore_, a Gentleman of good Reputation in _Carolina_, told me, that he has seen an _Indian_ daub himself with the Juice of this Plant; immediately after which, he handled a Rattle-Snake with his naked Hands without receiving any harm from it, though thought to be the most venomous of the Snake-kind: And I have heard several others affirm, that they have seen the _Indians_ use a Plant to guard themselves against the venom of this sort of Snake; but they were not Observers nice enough to inform me what kind it was of.

# 36

## Passer Nivalis: The Snow-bird.

The Bill of this Bird is white: The Breast, and Belly white. All the rest of the body black; but in some places dusky, inclining to Lead-colour. In _Virginia_ and _Carolina_ they appear only in Winter: and in Snow they appear most. In Summer none are seen. Whether they retire and breed in the North (which is most probable) or where they go, when they leave these Countries in the Spring, is to me unknown.


## Orobanche Virginiana flore pentapetulo cernuo: Broom-Rape.

This Plant rises to the height of eight or ten inches; is of a Flesh - Colour; the stalks thinly beset with small narrow sharp-pointed Leaves. The Flowers are monopetalous, but deeply furrow'd from the stalk to the Top of the Flower, where it divides into several sections. Whithin the Flower is an oval chanulated _capsula_, of the size of a Hazel-Nut, containing very small Seeds like Dust. This _Capsula_ is sourrunded with rnany yellow _Stamina_.

# 37

## Passerculus Bicolor Bahamensis: The Bahama Sparrow.

This is about the size of a Canary Bird. The Head, Neck, and Breast are black: All the other Parts of it of a dirty green Colour. It is the commonest little Bird I observed in the Woods of the _Bahama_ Islands. It uses to perch on the top of a Bush, and sing, repeating one set Tune in manner of our _Chaffinch_.

## Bignonia arbor pentaphylla flore roseo majore siliquis planis: Bignonia.

This Shrub usually rises to the height of about ten Feet. From the larger Branches shoots forth long slender Stalks, at the end of every of which are five leaves fixed on foot-stalks an inch long. Its flower is monopetalous, of a Rose-colour, and somewhat Bell-shaped, though the margin is deeply divided into five or six Sections, to which succeed Pods of five Inches long, hanging in Clusters, and containing within them small brown Beans.

# 38

## Coccothraustes Rubra: The Red Bird.

In Bigness it equals if not exceeds the Sky-Lark. The Bill is of a pale red, very thick and strong. A black Lift encompasses the Basis of it. The Head is adorned with a towering Crest, which it raises and falls at Pleausure. Except the Black round the Basis of the Bill, the whole Bird is scarlet, though the Back and Tail have least Lustre, being darker and of a more Cloudy red.

The Hen is brown; yet has a tincture of red on her Wings, Bill and other parts. They often sing in Cages as well as the Cocks. These Birds are common in all parts of _America_, from _New England_ to the _Capes_ of _Florida_, and probably much more South. They are seldom seen above three or four together. They have a very great Strength with their Bill, with which they will breack the harden Grain of _Maiz_ with much facility. It is a hardy and familiar Bird. They are frequently brought from _Virginia_ and other parts of _North America_ for their Beauty and agreable Singing, they having some Notes not unlike our Nightingale, which in _England_ seems to have caused its Name of the _Virginia Nightingale_, though in those Countries they call it the _Red Bird_.


## Nux Juglans alba Virgiensis: The Hiccory Tree.

This usually a tall Tree, and oftenn grows to a large Bulk, the Body being from two to three Feet Diameter. The Leaves are serrated, narrower and sharper pointed than the Walnut, but in Manner of growing on foot-stalks, like it. The Nuts are inclosed in like manner with the Walnut, with an outer and inner Shell. In _October_, at which time they are ripe, the outer Shell opens and divides in Quarters, disclosing the Nut, the shell of which is thick, not easily broke but with a Hammer. The Kernel is sweet and well tasted, from which the _Indians_ draw a wholesome and pleasant Oil, storing them up for their Winter-Provision. The Hogs and many wild Animals receive great Benefit from them. The Wood is course-grained; yet of much use for many things belonging to Agriculture. Of the Saplings or young Trees are made the best Hoops for Tobacco, Rice and Tar-Barrels: And for the Fire no Wood in the Northern parts of _America_ is in so much Request. The Bark is deeply furrowed.


### Nux Juglians Caralinensis fructu minimo putamine levi: The Pignut.

The Branches of this Tree spread more, are smaller, and the Leaves not so broad as the _Hiccory_; nor is the Bark so wrinkled. The Nuts are not above one forth part so big as those of the _Hiccory_, having both the inner and outer shell very thin; so that they may easily be broke with one's Fingers. The kernels are sweet; but being small, and covered with a very hitter skin, makes them usuless, except for Squirrels and other Wild Creatures.

Another Walnut remains to be observed, which I never saw but in _Virginia_ and is there called the white Walnut. The Tree is usually small; the Bark and Grain of the Wood very White: The Nut is About the size or rather less than the black Walnut, of an oval form, the outermost shell being rough.

# 39

## Coccothraustes Caerulea: The Blue Gross-beak.

A Narrow black Lift encompasses the Basis of the Bill, and joins to the Eyes: The Head and whole Body, except the Tail and part of the Wings, of a deep blue. Below the shoulder of the Wing are a few red Feathers: The lower part of the Wing and Tail brown, with a mixture of green; The Legs and Feet of a dusky black.

The Hen is all over dark brown, with a very small mixture of blue. It is a very uncommon and solitary bird, seen only in Pairs. They have one single Note only, and appear not in Winter. I have not seen any of these Birds in any parts of _America_ but _Carolina_.

## Magnolia Lauri folio, subtus albicante: The Sweet Sweet Flowering Bay.

This is a small Tree, usually growing sixteen Foot high; the Wood white and spongy, covered with a white Bark. The Leaves are in shape like those of the common Bay, but of a pale green, having their back-sides white: In _May_ they begin to blossom, continuing most part of the Summer to perfume the Woods with their fragrant flowers, which are white, made up of six _Petala_, having a rough conic _Stylus_, or rudiment of the Fruit: which, when the _Petala_ fall, increases to the bigness and shape of a large Walnut, thick set with knobs or risings; from every of which, when the Fruit is ripe, is discharged flat Seeds of the bigness of _French_ Beans, having a kernel within a thin Shell, covered with a red Skin. These red Seeds, when discharged from their cells, fall not to the ground, but are supported by small white threads of about two Inches long. The Fruit at first is green; when ripe, red; and when declining, it turns brown: They grow naturally in moist places, and often in shallow Water; and what is extraordinary, they being removed on high dry ground, become more regular and handsomer Trees, and are more prolific of flowers and fruit: They usually lose their leaves in Winter, except it be moderate.


This beautiful flowring Tree is a Native both of _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, and is growing at Mr. _Fairchild_'s in _Hoxton_, and at Mr. _Collinson_'s at _Peckham_, where it has for some years past produced its fragrant Blossoms, requiring no protection from the Cold of our severest Winters.

## Coccothraustes Purpurea: The Purple Gross-beak.

This Bird is of the Size of a Sparrow. Over the Eyes, the Throat, and at the Vent under the Tail, are Spoots of red: All the rest of the Body is entirely of a deep purple Colour. The Hen is all over brown, but has the like red Spots as the Cock. These Birds are Natives of many of the _Bahama_ Islands.


## Toxicodendron foliis alatis fructu purpureo Pyri formi Sparso: The Poison Wood.

This is generally but a small Tree, has a light coloured smooth bark. Its leaves are winged, the middle rib seven or eight inches long, with pairs of _Pinnae_ one against another on inch-long foot-stalks. The fruit hang in bunches; are shaped like a Pear, of a pourple Colour, covering an oblong hard Stone.

From the trunc of this Tree distils a liquid black as Ink, which the Inhabitans say is Poison. Birds feed on the Berries, particularly this _Gross-beak_ on the mucilage that covers the Stone. It grows usually on Rocks in _Providence_, _Ilathera_ and other of the _Bahama_ Islands.

# 41

## Fringilla Purpurea: The Purple Finch.

In Size and Shape this Bird differs but little from our Chaffinch.	 The Belly is White: The rest of the Body is of a dusky purple Colour; but with a Mixture of Brown in some Parts; particularly, the interior Vanes of the Wing-Feathers are brown, as are the Tail-Feathers towards the End. The Hen is brown, having her Breast spotted like our _Mavis_. When they first appear in _Carolina_ (which is usually in _November_) they feed on the Berries of Juniper; and in _February_ they destroy the swelling Buds of Fruit-Trees, in like Manner as our Bull-finches. They associate in small Flights, and retire at the Approach of Winter.


## Arbor in aqua nascens, foliis latis acuminatis & non dentatis fructu Eleagni minore: The Tupelo Tree.

This Tree usually grows large and spreading, with an erect trunc and regular Head. The Leaves are shaped like those of the Bay-Tree.	 In Autumn its Branches are thick set with oval black Berries on long Foot-stalks, each Berry having a hard channell'd flattish Stone. These Berries have a very sharp and bitter Tast:, yet are Food for many wild Animals, particularly _Raccoons_, _Oppossums_, _Bears_, &c. The Grain of the wood is curled and very tough, and therefore very proper for Naves of Cart-wheels and other Country-Uses. They grow usually in moist Places, in _Virginia_, _Maryland_ and _Carolina_.

# 42

## Fringilla Bahamensis: The _Bahama_ Finch.

It weighs fourteen Penny Weight. The Head is black; except a white Line which runs from the Bill over the Eve, and another under the Eye. The Throat is black, except a yellow Spot, close under the Bill. The Breast is Orange-colour'd ; the Belly white; the Upper-part of the Neck and the Rump, of a dusky red; the Back black; the Wings and Tail brown, with a mixture of white; the Legs and Feet, Lead-Colour. These Birds are frequent on many of the _Bahama_ Islands.


## Arbor Guajaci latiore folio, Bignoniae flore caeruleo, fructu duro in duas partes desiliente, seminibus alatis imbricatim positis: The broad leaf'd Guaicum, with blue Flowers.

This is a Tree of a Middle-size. The leaves are winged, with many small pointed alternate Lobes. In _May_ there proceeds from the ends of its Branches several spreading Foot-stalks bearing blue Flowers, in Form not unlike those of the Fox-glove, which are succeeded by large flat roundish Seed-Vessels, or Pods, commonly two Inches over, containing many, small flat winged Seeds. This Tree grows on several of the _Bahama_ Islands, particularly near the Town of _Nasaw_, on the Island of _Providence_.

# 43

## Carduelis Americanus: The American Goldfinch.

This agrees, in Size and Shape, with our Gold-finch. The Bill is of a dusky white; the Fore-part of the Head black; the Back-part of a dirty green. All the Under-part of the Body, from the Bill to the Vent, and likewise the Back, of a bright yellow; the Wings black, having some of the smaller Feathers edged with dusky white; the Legs and Feet brown. They feed on Lettice and Thistle Seed. These Birds are not common in _Carolina_. In _Virginia_ they are more frequent; and at _New-York_ they are most numerous; and are there commonly kept in Cages.


## Acacia Abruae foliis, triacanthos, capsula ovali unicum semen claudente: Acacia.

This Tree grows to a large Size and spreading. The Leaves are winged, composed of many small pointed Lobes, like most others of its Tribe.	 The Fruit is somewhat like a Bean, contained in an oval _Capsula_, and grows commonly five or six together in a Bunch. Many very large sharp Thorns are set on its Branches and larger Limbs. This Tree I never saw but at the Plantation of Mr. _Waring_ on _Ashley_ River, growing in shallow Water.

# 44

## Fringilla Tricolor: The Painted Finch.

This weighs nine Penny weight, and is about the bigness of a Canary Bird. The Head and upper part of the Neck, of an Ultramarine blue. The Throat, Breast and Belly of a bright Red: The Back green, inclining to yellow. The Wings are composed of green, purple and dusky red Feathers: The Rump red: The Tail dusky red with Mixture of Purple. Tho' a particular Description may be requisite, in order to give the more perfect Idea of this Bird, yet its Colours may be comprised in Three: The Head and Neck are blue; the Belly red, and the Back green. Its Notes are soft; but have not much Variety. They breed in _Carolina_, and affect much to make their Nests in Orange-Trees. They do not continue there in Winter; nor do they frequent the Upper-parts of the Country. I never saw one fifty Miles from the Sea. Tho' the Cock is so elegant, the Hen is as remarkable for her plain Colour, which is not unlike that of a Hen-Sparrow, but with a faint Tinture of Green.

His Excellency, Mr. _Johnson_, the present Governour of _South-Carolina_, kept four or five of these Birds (taken from the Nest) in Cages two Years; in all which Time the Cocks and Hens varied so little in Colour, that it was not easy to distinguish them. I have likewise caught the Cock and Hen from their Nest, and could see little difference, they being both alike brown. How many Years it is before they come to their full Colour, is uncertain. When they are brought into this cold Climate, they lose much of their Lustre, as appear'd by some I brought along, with me. The _Spaniards_ call this Bird _Mariposa pintada_, or the Painted Butterfly.


## Alcea Floridana quinque capsularis Laurinus foliis, leviter crenatis, seminibus coniferarum instar alatis: The Loblolly Bay.

This is a tall and very straight Tree, with a regular Piramidal shaped Head. Its Leaves are shap'd like those of the commonl Bay, but serrated. It begins to blossom in _May_, and continues bringing forth its Flowers the greatest part of the Summer. The flowers are fixed to Foot-stalks four or five Inches long; are monopetalous, divided into five Segments encompassing a Tuft of _Stamina_, headed with yellow _Apices_; which Flowers in _November_ are succeeded by a conic _Capsula_ having a divided _Calix_. The _Capsula_ when ripe opens and divides into five Sections, disclosing many small half winged Seeds. This Tree reatins its leaves all the Year, and grows only in wet Places, and usually in Water. The Wood is somewhat soft; yet I have seen some beautiful Tables made of it. It grows in _Carolina_; but not in any of the more Northern Colonies.

# 45

## Linaria Caerulea: The blue Linnet.

This Bird is rather less than a Goldfinch; weighing eight Penny-weight. The whole Bird appears, at a little Distance, of an intire blue Colour; but, upon a nearer View, it is as follows: The Bill black and Lead-Colour. On the Crown of the Head the blue is most resplendent and deeper than in any other Part. The Neck, Back and Belly of a lighter blue. The large Wing-Feathers are brown, edged with blue. The Tail is brown, with a Tincture of blue. There are none of these Birds within the Settlements of _Carolina_; I never having seen any nearer than 150 Miles from the Sea; Their Abode being in the hilly Parts of the Country only. Their Notes are somewhat like those of our Linnets.

The _Spaniards_ in _Mexico_ call this Bird _Azul lexos_, or the far fetch'd Blue-Bird.

## Solanum triphylion flore hexapetalo carneo.

This has a tuberous Root; from which shoots forth two or three straight Stalks, of about eight Inches high; on which are set triangularly three ribbed Leaves; from between which proceeds its Flower, of a pale Red, composed of six spreading Leaves, three large and three smaller, with _Stamina_ of unequal Lengths. The Flower is succeeded by its Seed-Vessel, in Form and Size of a small Hazel-Nut, but somwhat channell'd, and cover'd by a _Perianthium_, which divides in Three, and turns back. The _Capsula_ contains innumerable small Seeds, like Dust. This Plant I found at the Sources of great Rivers; not having seen any in the inhabited Parts of _Carolina_.

# 46

## Garrulus Carolinensis: The Chatterer.

It weighs an Ounce and is rather less than a Sparrow; The Bill black; the Mouth and Throat large. From the Nostrils runs a black Lift to the back of its Head, like Velvet, with a Line of white on the lower Edge, in which stand the Eyes. The rest of its Head and Neck, brown. On its Crown is a piramidal Creft of the same Colour. The Breast is brown; the Back and Covert-Feathers of the Wing somewhat darker; the Belly pale, and yellow. What distinguishes this Bird from others, are eight small red Patches at the Extremities of eight of the smaller Wing-Feathers, of the Colour and Consistence of red Sealing-Wax. When the Wing is clos'd, these Patches unite, and form a large red Spot. The Tail is black, except the End, Which is yellow.

## Frutex corni foliis conjugatis; floribus instar Anemones Stellatae, petalis crassis, rigidis, colore sordide rubente; cortice aromatico.

This Shrub usually grows about eight or ten Foot high. The Leaves are set opposite to each other. The Flowers resemble, in Form, those of the _Star-Anemony_, compos'd of many stiff Copper-colour'd Petals, enclosing a Tuft of short yellow _Stamina_. The Flowers are succeded by a roundish Fruit flat at Top. The Bark is very aromatic, and as odoriferous as Cinnamon. These Trees grow in the remote and hilly Parts of _Carolina_, but no where amongst the Inhabitants.

# 47

## Rubicula Americana Caerulea: The Blue Bird.

This Bird weighs nineteen Penny Weight and is about the bigness of a Sparrow. The Eyes are large. The Head and upper-part of the Body, Tail and Wings are of a bright blue, except that the Ends of the Wing-Feathers are brown. The Throat and Breast, of a dirty Red: The Belly white. 'Tis a Bird of a very swift Flight, its Wings being very long; so that the Hawk generally pursues it in vain. They make their Nests in Holes of Trees; are harmless Birds, and resemble our Robin-red-breast. They feed on Insects only.

These Birds are common in most Parts of _North America_, I having seen them in _Carolina_, _Virginia_, _Maryland_, and the _Bermudas_ Islands.

## Smilax non Spinosa, humilis, folio Aristolochioe, baccis rubris.

This Plant sometimes trails on the Ground, the Leaves resembling those of the _Birth-wort_, set alternately on it slender Stalks; from which hang Clusters of small berries of an oval Form but pointed, each containing a very hard round Seed.

# 48

## Icterus Ex Aureo Nigroque varius: The Baltimore-Bird.

Is about the Size of a Sparrow; Weighing a little above an Ounce. The Bill is sharp and tapering; the Head and half way down the Back of a shining Black. The Wings, except the Upper-Parts (which are yellow) are black, with most of the Feathers edged on both Sides with White. The rest of the Body is of a bright Colour, between Red and Yellow. The two uppermost Feathers of the Tail are Black; the Rest Yellow: The Legs and Feet of a Lead-Colour. It disappears in Winter. This Gold-colour'd Bird I have only seen in _Virginia_ and _Maryland_; there being none of them in _Carolina_. It is said to have its Name from the Lord _Baltimore_'s Coat of Arms, which are Paly of six Topaz and Diamond, a Bend, counterchang'd ; his Lordship being a Proprietor in those Countries. It breeds on the Branches of tall Trees, and usually on the Poplar or Tulip Tree. Its Nest is built in a particular Manner, supported only by two Twigs fix'd to the Verge of the Nest, and hanging most commonly at the Extremity of a Bough.

## Arbor Tulipsera Virginiana tripartito aceris folio, media lacinia velut abscissa.

This Tree grows to a very large Size; some of them being Thirty Foot in Circumference. Its Boughs are very unequal and irregular, not streight, but making several Bends or Elbows; which peculiarly makes this Tree distinguishable at a great Distance, from all other Trees, even when it has lost its Leaves. The Leaves stand on Foot-stalks, about a Finger in Length: They somewhat resemble the smaller Maple in Shape, but are usually five or six Inches over, and instead of being pointed at the End, seem to be cut off with a Notch.

The Flowers have been always compared to Tulips: whence the Tree has received its Name; tho', I think, in shape they resemble more the _Fritillaria_. They are composed of seven or eight _Petala_; the Upper-part being of a pale-green, and the Lower-part shaded with red and a little yellow intermix'd. They are at first enclosed by a _Perianthium_, which opens and falls back when the Flower blows. These Trees are found in most parts of the Northern Continent of _America_, from the Cape of _Florida_ to _New-England_. The Timber is of great Use.

# 49

## Icterus Minor: The Bastard Baltimore.

Weighs thirteen Penny Weight. The Bill is sharp-pointed; The Throat black; the Tail brown; as are its Wings, having most of the Feathers verged with White. All the rest of the Bird is yellow, the Breast being brighest.

The Hen being as handsomly cloathed (tho' with very different colour'd Feathers) induc'd me to give the Figures of both. Her Head and Upper-part of the Back are of a shining Black; The Breast and Belly of a dirty Red; as is the lower Part of the Back and Rump. The Upper-part of the Wing is red; The lower part dusky black; The Tail black; The Legs and Feet blue in both Sexes.

## Bignonia Urucu foliis flore sordide albo, intus maculis purpureis & luteis asperso, siliqua longissima & angustissima: The Catalpa-Tree.

This is usually a small Tree, seldom rising above 23 Foot in Height. The Bark smooth: The Wood soft and spongy; the Leaves shaped like those of the _Lilax_, but much larger, some being ten Inches over. In _May_ it produces spreading Bunches of tubulous Flowers, like the common Fox-glove, white, only variegated with a few redish purple Spots and yellow Streaks on the Inside. The _Cadix_ is of a Copper-Colour. These Flowers are succeeded by round Pods, about the thickness of ones Finger, fourteen Inches in Length; which, when ripe, opens and displays its Seeds, which are winged, and lie over each other like the Scales of Fish. This Tree was unknown the inhabited Parts of _Carolina_, till I brought the Seeds from the remoter Parts of the Country. And tho' the Inhabitants are little curious in Gardening, yet the uncommon Beauty of the Tree has induc'd them to propagate it; and 'tis become an Ornament to many of their Gardens, and probably will be the same to ours in _England_, it being as hardy as most of our _American_ Plants; many of them now at Mr. _Christopher Grays_, at _Fulham_, having stood out several Winters, and produced plentifully their beautiful Flowers, without any Protection, except the first Year.

# 50

## Oenanthe Americana Pectore Luteo: The yellow breasted Chat.

This is about the Size of our Sky-Lark: The Bill black; the Head and all the Upper-part of the Back and Wings, of a brownish Green; the Neck and Breast yellow. A white Streak reaches from the Nostrils over the Eye; under which is also a white Spot. From the lower Mandible of the Bill runs a narrow white Line. The Belly is dusky White; the Tail brown: The Legs and Feet are black. This Bird I never saw in the inhabited Parts. They frequent the Upper-parts of the Country, 200 and 300 Miles distant from the Sea. They are very shy Birds, and hide themselves so obscurely that after many Hours Attempt to shoot one, I was at last necessiated to employ an _Indian_, who did it not without the utmost of his Skill. They frequent the Banks of great Rivers; and their loud chattering Noise reverberates from the hollow Rocks and deep Cane-Swamps. The Figure represents the singular Manner of their Flying with their Legs extended.

## Solanum triphyllon flore hexapetalo tribus petalis purpureis erectis caeteris viridibus reflexis.

This Plant rises with a single strait Stalk, five or fix Inches high; from the Top of which spreads forth three broad pointed Leaves, placed triangularly, and hanging down. These Leaves have each three Ribs, and are variegated with dark and lighter Green. From between these Leaves shoots forth the Flower, consisting of three purple Petals growing erect, having its _Perianthium_ divided in Three. They grow in shady Thickets in most parts of _Carolina_.

# 51

## Hirundo Purpurea: The Purple Martin.

Is larger than our common Martin. The whole Bird is of a dark shining Purple; the Wings and Tail being more dusky and inclining to Brown. They breed like Pigeons in Lockers prepared for them against Houses, and in Gourds hung on Poles for them to build in, they being of great Use about Houses and Yards for pursuing and chasing away Crows, Hawks, and other Vermin from the Poultry. They retire at the Approach of Winter, and return in the Spring to _Virginia_ and _Carolina_.

## Smilax (forte) lenis, folio anguloso hederaceo.

The Stalks of this Plant are slender, running up the Walls of old Houses, and twining about Posts and Trees. The Leaves resemble our common Ivy. I never saw it in Flower; but it bears red Berries, about the Bigness of small Peas, which grow in Clusters.

# 52

## Muscicapa Cristata Ventre Luteo: The crested Fly-Catcher.

Weighs one Ounce. The Bill is black and broad; the Upper-part of the Body of a muddy Green; the Neck and Breast of a Lead-Colour; the Belly yellow; the Wings brown, having most of the Vanes of the Quill-Feathers edg'd with Red. The two middle Feathers of the Tail are all brown; The interior Vanes of the Rest are red. The Legs and Feet black. It breeds in _Carolina_ and _Virginia_, but retires in Winter.

This Bird by its ungrateful brawling Noise, seems at Variance and displeased with all others.

## Smilax Bryoniae nigrae foliis caule spinoso, baccis nigris.

This plant shoots forth with many pliant thorny Stems; which, when at full Bigness, are as big as a Walking Cane, and jointed; and rises to the Height usally of twenty Feet, climbing upon and spreading over the adjacent Trees and shrubs, by the Assistance o f its Tendrels. In Autumn it produces Clusters of black round Berries, hanging pendent to a Foot-Stalk, above three Inches long, each Berry containing a very hard roundish Seed. The Roots of this Plant are tuberous divided into many Knots and joints; and, when first dug out of the Ground, are soft and juicy, but harden in the Air to the Consistence of Wood. Of these Roots the Inhabitants of _Carolina_ make a Diet-Drink, attributing great Virtues to it in cleansing the Blood _&c_. They likewise in the Spring boil the tender Shoots and eat them prepared like Asparagus. 'Tis call'd there _China_ Root.

# 53

## Muscicapa Nigresscens: The Blackcap Fly-Catcher.

The Bi11 is broad and black; the Upper-part of the Head of a dusky black; the Back, Wings and Tail are brown, the Breast and Belly white, with a Tincture of yellowish Green. The Legs and Feet are black. The Head of the Cock is of a deeper black than that of the Hen, which is all the Difference between them. I don't remember to have seen any of them in Winter. They feed on Flies and other Insects. They breed in _Carolina_.

## Gelseminum, sive Jasminum luteum odoratum Virginianum seandens, semper virens.

This Plant grows usually in moist Places, its Branches being supported by other Trees and Shrubs on which it climbs. The Leaves grow opposite to each other from the Joints of the Stalks; from whence likewise shoot forth yellow tubulous Flowers; the Verges of which are notched or divided into five Sections. The Seeds are flat and half winged, contained in an oblong pointed _Capsula_, which, when the Seeds are ripe, splits to the Stalk and discharges them. The Smell of the Flowers is like that of the Wall-Flowers. These Plants are scarce in _Virginia_, but are every where in _Carolina_. They are likewise at Mr. _Grays_ at _Fulham_; where, by their thriving State, they seem to like our Soil and Climate. Tho' Mr. _Parkinson_ calls it _semper virens_, I have always found it lose its Leaves in Winter.

# 54

## Muscicapa Fusca: The little brown Fly-catcher.

Weighs nine Penny-weight. The Bill is very broad and flat; the upper Mandible black; the lower yellow. All the Upper-part of the Body of a dark Ash-Colour. The Wings are brown, with some of the Feathers edged with White: All the Under-part of the Body dusky white, with a Tincture of yellow: The Legs and Feet black.


## Muscicapa Oculis Rubris: The red-ey'd Fly-catcher.

Weighs ten Penny-weight and an half. The Bill Lead-Colour: The Iris of the Eyes red. From the Bill, over the Eyes, runs a dusky white Line, border'd above with a black Line. The Crown of the Head is gray. The Rest of the Upper-part of the Body is green. The Neck, Breast and Belly white; the Legs and Feet black. Both these breed in _Carolina_, and retire Southward in Winter.

This Shrub has a slender Stem, and grows usually about eight or ten Feet high. Its Leaves are in Shape like those of a Pear, growing alternately on Foot-stalks of an Inch long; from between which proceeds small whitish Flowers, consisting of five Petals; in the Middle of which shoot forth many tall _Stamina_, headed with yellow _Apices_. The Roots of this Plant are made Use of in Decoctions, and are esteemed a good Stomachic and Cleanser of the Blood. The Fruit I have not seen. This Plant grows in moist and shady Woods, in the lower Parts of _Carolina_.

# 55

## Muscicapa Corona Rubra: The Tyrant.

The Bill is broad, flat and tapering. The Crown of the Head has a bright red Spot, environ'd with black Feathers; which, by contracting, conceals the Red; but, when they are spread, it appears with much Lustre after the Manner of the _Regulus cristatus_. The Back, Wings and Tail are brown; the Neck, Breast and Belly white; the Legs and Feet black. There appears little or no Difference between the Cock and Hen. They appear in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_ about _April_, where they breed, and retire at the Approach of Winter. The Courage of this little Bird is singular. He pursues and puts to Flight all kinds of Birds that come near his Station, from the smallest to the largest, none escaping his Fury; nor did I ever see any that dar'd to oppose him while flying; for he does not offer to attack them when sitting. I have seen one of them six on the Back of an Eagle, and persecute him so, that he has turned on his Back into various Postures in the Air, in order to get rid of him, and at last was forc'd to alight on the Top of the next Tree, from whence he dared not move, till the little Tyrant was tired, or thought fit to leave him. This is the constant Practice of the Cock while the Hen is brooding: He sits on the Top of a Bush, or small Tree, not far from her Nest; near which if any small Birds approach, he drives them away; but the great Ones, as Crows, Hawks, and Eagles, he won't suffer to come within a Quarter of a Mile of him without attacking them. They have only a chattering Note, which they utter with great Vehemence all the Time they are fighting. When their Young are flown, they are as peaceable as other Birds. It has a tender Bill, and feeds on Infects only. They are tame and harmless Birds. They build their Nest in an open manner on low Trees and Shrubs, and usually on the Sassafras Tree.

## Cornus mas odorata, folio trifido margine plano, Sassafras dicta.

This is generally a small Tree; the Trunc usually not a Foot thick. The Leaves are divided into three Lobes by very deep Incisures. In _March_ comes forth Bunches of small yellow Flowers with five Petals each; which are succeeded by Berries, in Size and Shape not unlike those of the Bay-Tree, hanging on red Footstalks, with a _Calix_ like that of an Acorn; which _Calix_ is also red. The Berries are at first green, and, when ripe, blue. These Trees grow in most Parts of the Northern Continent of _America_, and generally on very good Land. The Virtue of this Tree is well known, as a great sweetner of the Blood: I shall therefore only add, that in _Virginia_ a strong Decoction of the Root has been sometimes given with good Success for an intermitting Fever. This Tree will hear our Climate, as appears by several now at Mr. _Collinson_'s at _Peckham_, and at Mr. _Grays_ in _Fulham_; where they have withstood the cold of several Winters.

# 56

## Muscicapa Rubra: The Summer Red-Bird.

This is about the Size of a Sparrow. It has large black Eyes. The Bill thick and clumsy and of a yellowish Cast. The whole Bird is of a bright Red, except the interior Vanes of the Wing-Feathers, which are brown, but appear not unless the Wings are spread. They are Birds of Passage, leaving _Virginia_ and _Carolina_ in Winter. The Hen is brown with a Tincture of yellow.

## Platanus Occidentalis: The Western Plane-Tree.

This Tree usually grows very large and tall. Its Leaves are broad, of a light Green, and somewhat downy on the Back-side. Its Seed-Vessels are globular, hanging single and pendent on Foot-stalks of about four or five Inches long: The Fruit in the Texture of it, resembling that of the _Platanus Orientalis_. The Bark is smooth and usually so variegated with White and Green, that they have a fine Effect amongst the other Trees. In _Virginia_ they are plentifully found in all the lower Parts of the Country; but in _Carolina_ there are but few, except on the hilly Parts, particularly on the Banks of _Savanna_ River.

# 57

## Parus Cristatus: The crested Titmouse.

It weighs thirteen Penny-weight. The Bill is black, having a Spot a little above it of the same Colour; except which, all the Upper-part of the Body is gray. The Neck and all the Under-part of the Body is white, with a faint Tincture of Red, which just below the Wings is deepest. The Legs and Feet are of a Lead-Colour. It erects its Crown-Feathers into a pointed Crest. No Difference appears between the Cock and Hen: They breed in and inhabit _Virginia_ and _Carolina_ all the Year. They do not frequent near Houses, their Abode being only amongst the Forest-Trees from which they get their Food; which is Insects.

## Cistus Virginiana, flore & odore Periclymeni: The Upright Honeysuckle.

This Plant rises usually with two or three stiff streight Stems, which are small, except where the Soil is very moist and rich; where they grow to the Size of a Walking Cane, twelve or sixteen Feet high, branching into many smaller Stalks, with Leaves alternately placed. At the Ends of the Stalks are produced Bunches of Flowers, resembling our common Honysuckle; not all of a Colour, some Plants producing White, some red, and others purplish, of a very pleasant Scent, tho' different from ours. The Flowers are succeeded by long pointed _Capsulas_, containing innumerable very small Seeds. 'Tis a Native of _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, but will endure our Climate in the open Air, having for some years past produc'd its beautiful and fragrant Blossoms at Mr. _Bacon_'s at _Hoxton_, at Mr. _Collinson_'s at _Peckham_; and at Mr. _Christopher Grays_ at _Fulham_.

# 58

## Parus Uropygeo Luteo: The Yellow-rump.

This is a Creeper, and seems to be of the Tit-kind. The most distinguish'd Part of this Bird is its Rump, which is yellow. All the rest of the Feathers are brown, having a faint Tincture of Green. It runs about the Bodies of Trees, and feeds on Infects, which it pecks from the Crevise of the Bark. The Hen differs little from the Cock in the Colour of its Feathers. They are found in _Virginia_.

## Helleborine Lilii folio caulem ambiente, flore unico hexapetalo, tribus petalis longis, angustis obscure purpureis, caeteris brevioribus roseis: The Lilly-Leaf'd Hellebore.

This Plant has a bulbous Root; from which arises a single Stem of about a Foot high, encompassed by the Bottom-part of one Leaf as by a Sheath. At the Top grows the Flower, composed of six _Petala_; three of them long, and of a dark purple Colour; the other three shorter, of a pale Rose-Colour, and commonly turning back, with a _Pistillum_ in the Middle. It grows in wet Places.

## Apocynum Scandens folio, cordato flore albo: Dogs-Bane.

This Plant climbs upon and is supported by Shrubs and Trees near it. Its Leaves grow opposite to each other, on Foot-stalks less than an Inch long. The Flowers grow usually four or five in a Cluster, are white, and consist of five _Petala_, succeeded by long cylindrical Pods, growing by Pairs, containing many flat Seeds not unlike the Rest of the _Apocynums_. It grows on most of the _Bahama_ Islands.

# 59

## Parus Bahamensis: The Bahama Titmouse.

The Bill of this Bird is black, and a little bending; the Upper-Part of the Head, Back and Wings brown. A white Line runs from the Bill over the eyes to the Back of the Head. The Breast is yellow, as are the Shoulders of the Wings. The Tail is somewhat long, having the Upper-part brown, and the Under dusky white.

Arbor Jasmini, floribus albis, foliis Cenchranmidea, fructu ovali, feminibus parvis nigris mucilagine involutis: The Seven Years Apple.

This Shrub grows from six or ten Feet High, with a Stem seldom bigger than ones Wrist, having a wrinkled light-colour'd Bark. The Leaves grow in Clusters, and are about the Bigness of those of our common Laurel, having, a wide Notch or Indenture at the End, which is broadest. These Leaves are very thick and stiff, and usually curl up as the Figure represents. The Flowers grow in Bunches; are monopetalous; and in Form and Size resemble our common Jessamin; white in Colour with a faint Tincture of Red. The Fruit hangs by a Foot-stalk of an Inch long, of an Oval Form, the Outside being shaded with Green, Red and Yellow. When ripe, it is of the Consistence of a mellow Pear, containing a pulpy Matter, in Colour, Substance and Taste not unlike the _Cassia fistula_. For nine Months I observ'd a continual succession of Flowers and Fruit, which ripens in seven or eight Months. I know not for what Reason the Inhabitants of the _Bahama_ Island (where it grows) call it the Seven Years Apple.

## Parus Cucullo Nigro: The Hooded Titmouse.

This is about the Size of a Gold-Finch: The Bill black. A broad black Lift encompasses the Neck and Hind-Part of the Head, resembling a Hood; except which the Fore-part of the Head and all the Under-part of the Body is Yellow. The Back, Wings and Tail are of a dirty Green. They frequent Thickets and shady Places in the uninhabited Parts of _Carolina_.

Arbor in aqua nascens foliis latis acuminatis & dentatis, fructo Eleagni majore: The Water-Tupelo.

This Tree has a large Trunc, especially near the Ground, and grows very tall. The Leaves are broad, irregularly notched or indented. From the Sides of the Branches shoot forth its Flowers, set on Foot-Stalks about three Inches long, consisting of several small narrow greenish _Petala_, on the Top of an oval Body, which is the Rudiment of the Fruit; at the Bottom of which its _Perianthium_ divides into Four. The Fruit, when full grown, is in Size, Shape and Colour like a small Spanish Olive, containing one hard channell'd Stone. The Grain of the Wood is white, soft and spongy. The Roots are much more so, approaching near to the Consistence of Cork, and are used in _Carolina_ for the same Purposes as Cork, to stop Gourds and Bottles. These Trees always grow in wet Places, and usually in the shallow Parts of Rivers and in Swamps.

# 61

## Parus Americanus Lutescens: The Pine-Creeper.

Weighs eight Penny-weight and five Grains. The Bill is black. The Upper-part of the Body, from the Bill to the Tail, of a yellowish green, The Neck and Breast yellow. The Belly near the tail, white. The Wings brown, with some Spots of white. The Tail brown; except the two outermost Feathers, which are half white. The Legs are dusky-black. The Hen is all over brown. They creep about Trees, particularly Pine- and Fir-Trees; from which they peck Insects and feed on them. These, with most of the other Creepers and Titmice, associate together in small Flights, and are mostly seen on leafless Trees in Winter.

Ligustrum Lauri folio, fructu violacco: The Purple-Berried Bay.

Usually sixteen Feet high, and the Trunc is from six to eight Inches in Diameter. The Leaves are very smooth, and of a brighter Green than the common Bay-Tree: Otherwise, in Shape and Manner of growing, it resembles it. In _March_ from between the Leaves, shoot forth Spikes, two or three Inches in Length, consisting of tetrapetalous very small white Flowers, growing opposite to each other, on Foot-stalks half an Inch long. The Fruit, which succeeds, are globular Berries, about the Size of Those of the Bay, and cover'd with a Purple-colour'd Skin, enclosing a Kernel, which divides in the Middle.

# 62

## Parus Americanus Gutture Luteo: The Yellowthroated Creeper.

Weighs seven Penny-weight. The Bill is black. The Forepart of the Head black, having two yellow Spots on each Side, next the upper Mandible. The Throat is of a bright yellow, border'd on each Side with a black Lift. The Back and Hind-part of the Head are grey. The Wings are of a darker grey, inclining to brown, with some of their covert Feathers edged with white. The Under-part of the Body white, with black Spots on each Side, next the Wings. The Tail black and white. The Feet are brown; and, like those of the _Certhia_, have very long Claws, which assist them in creeping about Trees in Search of Insects, on which they feed. There is neither Black nor Yellow upon the Hen. They are frequent in _Carolina_.

## Acer Virginianum, folio majore, Subtus argenteo, Supra viridi Splendente: The Red Flow'ring Maple.

These Trees grow to a considerable Height; but their Truncs are not often very large. In _February_, before the Leaves appear, the little red Blossoms open, and continue in Flower about three Weeks; and are then succeeded by the Keys, which are also red, and, with the Flowers, continue about six Weeks, adorning the Woods earlier than any other Forest-Trees in _Carolina_. They endure our _English_ Climate as well as they do their native one; as appears by many large Ones in the Garden of Mr. _Bacon_ at _Hoxton_.

# 63

## Parus Carolinensis Luteus: The Yellow Titmouse.

It is less than a Wren. It appears all Yellow; but, on a near View, is as follows. The Bill is slender. The Head, Breast, and Belly are bright Yellow. The Back is of a greenish Yellow. The Tail Brown, with a Mixture of Yellow. The Hen is not of so bright a Yellow as the Cock. It breeds in _Carolina_, but retires at the Approach of Winter.

Laurus Carolinensis, foliis acuminatis, baccis caerulis, pediculis longis rubris infidentibus: The Red Bay.

The Leaves of this Tree are in Shape like those of the common Bay, and of an Aromatic Scent. The Berries, when ripe, are blue, growing two, and sometimes three together, on Foot-stalks of two or three Inches long, of a red Colour, as is the _Calix_ or Cup of the Fruit, and indented about the Edges. These Trees are not common in _Virginia_, except in some Places near the Sea. In _Carolina_ they are every where seen, particularly in low swampy Lands. In general, they arrive to the Size of but small Trees and Shrubs; tho' in some Islands, and particular Places near the Sea, they grow to large and strait bodied Trees. The Wood is fine-grain'd, and of excellent Use for Cabinets, &c. I have seen some of the best of this Wood selected, that has resembled Water'd Sattin; and has exceeded in Beauty any other Kind of Wood I ever saw.

# 64

## Parus Fringillaris: The Finch-Creeper.

It Weighs five Penny-weight. The upper Mandible of the Bill is brown. The Under, yellow. The Head blue. It hath a white Spot over, and another under each Eye. The Upper-part of the Back is of a yellowish green. The Rest of the Upper-part of the Body, Wings, and Tail, of a dusky blue; the scapular Feathers having some white Spots. The Throat is yellow. The Breast, of a deeper yellow, divided by a dark blue Lift. The Belly white. Near the Breast some Feathers are stain'd with red. The Feet are dusky yellow. The Feathers of the Hen are black and brown. These Birds creep about the Trunks of large Trees; and feed on Insects, which they gather from the Crevices of the Bark. They remain the winter in _Carolina_.

## Frutex, Padi foliis non serratis, floribus monopetalis albis, campani-formibus, fructu crasso tetragano.

The Trunc of this Shrub is slender. Sometimes two or three Stems rise from the same Root to the Height usually of ten Feet. The Leaves are in Shape like Those of a Pear. In _February_ and _March_, come white Flowers, in Form of a Bell, hanging usually two and three together, on Inch-long Foot Stalks, from the Sides of the Branches. From the Middle of the Flower shoot forth four _Stamina_, with a _Stylus_ extending half an Inch beyond them, of a reddish Colour. These Flowers are succeeded by oblong quadrangular Seed-Vessels, pointed at the Ends.

# 65

## Mellivora Avis Carolinensis: The Humming-Bird.

There is but one kind of this Bird in _Carolina_ which in the Summer frequents the Northern Continent as far as _New England_. The Body is about the Size of a _Humble Bee_. The Bill is strait, black, and three Quarters of an Inch long. The Eyes are black; the Upper-part of the Body and Head of a shining Green; the whole Throat adorned with Feathers placed like the Scales of Fish, of a crimfon metallic: Resplendency; the Belly dusky white; the Wings of a singular Shape, not unlike the Blade of a _Turkish_ Cymiter; the Tail Copper-Colour, except the uppermost Feather, which is green. The Legs are very short and black. It receives its Food from Flowers, after the Manner of Bees; its Tongue being a Tube, thro' which it sucks the Honey from 'em. It so poises it self by the quick hovering of its Wings, that it seems without Motion in the Air. They rove from Flower to Flower, on which they wholly subsist. I never observed nor heard, that they feed on any Insect or other thing than Flowers. They breed in _Carolina_, and retire at the Approach of Winter.

What _Lerius_ and _Thevet_ say of their Singing, is just as true as what is said of the Harmony of Swans; for they have no other Note than _Screep_, _Screep_, as _Margravius_ truly observes.

_Hernandes_ bespeaks the Credit of his Readers by saying, 'tis no idle Tale when he affirms the Manner of their lying torpid, or sleeping, all Winter; in _Hispaniola_, and many other Places between the _Tropicks_, I have seen these Birds all the Year round, there being a perpetual Succession of Flowers for them to subsist on.

## Bignonia, Fraxini foliis, coccineo flore minore: The Trumpet-Flower.

These Plants climb upon Trees, on which they run a great Height; and are frequently seen to cover the dead Truncs of tall Trees. The Leaves are winged, consisting of many serrated Lobes, standing by Couples, opposite to each other on one Rib. In _May, June, July_ and _August_, it produces Bunches of red Flowers, somewhat like the common _Foxglove_. Each Flower shoots from a long redish colour'd _Calix_; is monopetalous, swelling in the Middle, and opens a top into five Lips, with one Pointal arising from the _Calix_, thro' the Middle of the Flower. In _August_, the Cods or Seed-Vessels appear. They are, when full grown, eight Inches long, narrow at both Ends, and divide in two equal Parts, from Top to Bottom, displaying many flat winged Seeds.

The Humming Birds delight to feed on these Flowers; and, by thrusting themselves too far into the Flower, are sometimes caught.

# 66

## Muscicapa Vertice Nigro: The Cat-Bird.

This Bird is about the size of, or somewhat bigger than a Lark. The Crown of the Head is black; the Upper-part of the Body, Wings and Tail, dark brown; particularly the Tail approaches nearest to black. The Neck, Breast, and Belly, are of a lighter brown. From the Vent, under the Tail, shoot forth some Feathers, of a dirty red. This Bird is not seen on lofty Trees; but frequents Bushes and Thickets; and feeds on Insects. It has but one Note, which resembles the Mewing of a Cat, and which has given it its Name. It lays a blue Egg; and retires from _Virginia_ in Winter.

Alni, folia Americana Serrata, floribus pentapetalis albis, in Spicam dispositis.

This Shrub grows in moist Places, and sometimes in Water, from which it rises, with many slender Stems, to the Height of ten or fourteen Feet. The Leaves are somewhat rough, placed alternately, serrated, and in Shape not unlike Those of the White Thorn. In _July_ there shoots from the Ends of the Branches, Spikes of white Flowers, four or five Inches long. Each Flower consists of five Petals and a Tuft of small _Stamina_. These Flowers are thick set on Foostalks a Quarter of an Inch long; and are succeeded by small oval pointed _Capsula_'s, containing many chaffy Seeds. This Plant endures our Climate in the open Air; and flourishes at Mr. _Christ._ Gray's in _Fulham_.

# 67

## Ruticilla Americana: The Red-Start.

This Bird is about the Size of, or rather less than, our Red-start; and has a slender black Bill: The Head, Neck, Back, and Wings, are black; except, that Five or Six of the exterior Vanes of the larger Wing-Feathers are partly red. The Breast is red; but divided by a grey Lift; of which Colour is the Belly. The Tail is red, except the End, which is black. The Legs and Feet are black. T he Hens are brown.

These Birds frequent the shady Woods of _Virginia_; and are seen only in Summer.

## Nux juglans nigra Virginiensis: The Black Walnut.

Most Parts of the Northern Continent of _America_ abound with these Trees, particularly _Virginia_ and _Maryland_, towards the Heads of the Rivers, where in low rich Land, they grow in great Plenty, and to a vast Size. The Leaves are much narrower and sharper pointed than those of our Walnut, and not so smooth. The Thickness of the inner Shell requires a Hammer to break it. The outer Shell is very thick and rough on the Outside. The Kernels are very oily and rank tasted; yet, when laid by some Months, are eat by _Indians_, Squirrels, &c. It seems to have taken its Name from the Colour of the Wood, which approaches nearer to Black than any other Wood that affords so large Timber. Wherefore it is esteemed for making Cabinets, Tables, _&c_.

# 68

## Rubicilla Minor Nigra: The little black Bulfinch.

This is about the Size of a Canary Bird. The whole Bird is black, except the Shoulders of the Wings, and Part of the Vanes of two of the largest Wing Feathers, which are white. The Bill is thick and short, having a Notch in the upper Mandible like that of a Hawk. This Bird, is an Inhabitant of _Mexico_; and is called by the _Spaniards, Mariposa nigra_, i.e. Black Butterfly. Whether this be a Cock or Hen, I know not.

## Amelamchior Virginiana, Lauro cerasi folio: The Fringe Tree.

On the Banks of Rivulets and running Streams this shrub is most commonly found. It mounts from six to ten Feet high, usually with a crooked irregular small Stem. Its Leaves are of a light Green, and shaped like those of the _Orange_. In _May_, it produces Bunches of White Flowers hanging on branched Footstalks, of half an Inch long. Each Flower has four narrow thin Petals about two Inches long. Each Flower has four narrow thin Petals about two Inches long. To these succeed round dark blue Berries, of the Size of Sloes.

# 69

## Ispida: The King-Fisher.

This Kind of King's-fisher is somewhat larger than a Blackbird.	 The Bill is two Inches and an half long, and black. The Eyes are large. His Head is cover'd with long blewish Feathers. Under the Eye there is a white Spit, and another at the Basis of the upper Mandible of the Bill. All the Upper-part of the Body is of a dusky blue. The Neck is white, with a broad Lift of dusky blue cross it; under which the Breast is muddy red. The Belly is white. The Quill-Feathers of the Wing are black, having some white on their interior Vanes, edged with blue and black, with transverse white Spots, not appearing but when the Wing is spread often. The Tail is dusky blue, with the End white, as are most of the Qui11 Feathers. It has four Toes, one only being behind. Its Cry, its solitary Abode about Rivers, and its Manner of Feeding, are much the same as of those in _England_. It preys not only on Fish but likewise on Lizards.

## Myrtus, Brabanticae similis, Carolinensis, baccata, fructu racemoso sessili monopyreno: The narrow-leaved Candle-berry Myrtle.

These are usually but small Trees or Shrubs, aboat Twelve Foot high, with crooked Stems, branching forth near the Ground irregularly. The Leaves are long, narrow, and sharp-pointed. Some Trees have most of their Leaves serrated; others not. In _May_, the small Branches are alternately and thick set with oblong Tufts of very small Flowers resembling, in Form and Size, the Catkins of the Hazel-Tree, coloured with Red and Green. These are succeeded by small Clusters of blue Berries, close connected, like Bunches of Grapes. The Kernel is inclosed in an oblong hard Stone, incrustated over with an unctuous mealy Consistence; which is what yields the Wax; of which Candles are made in the following Manner.

In _November_ and _December_, at which time the Berries are mature, a Man with his Family will remove from his Home to some Island or Sandbanks near the Sea, where these Trees most abound, taking with him Kettles to boil the Berries in. He builds a Hut with _Palmeto_-Leaves, for the Shelter of Himself and Family while they stay, which is commonly Three or Four Weeks.

The Man cuts down the Trees, while the Children strip off the Berries into a Porrige-Pot; and having put Water to 'em, they boil them 'till the Oil floats, which is skim'd off into another Vessel. This is repeated till there remains no more Oil. This, when cold, hardens to the Consistence of Wax, and is of a dirty green Colour. Then they boil it Again, and clarify it in brass Kettles; which gives it a transparent Greenness.

These Candles burn a long Time, and yield a grateful Smell. They usually add a fourth Part of Tallow; which makes them burn clearer.

# 70

## Gallinula Americana: The Soree.

This Bird, in Size and Form, resembles our Water-Rail. The whole Body is cover'd with brown Feathers; the Under-part of the Body being lighter than the Upper. The Bill and Legs are brown. These Birds become so very fat in Autumn, by feeding on Wild Oats, that they can't escape the _Indians_, who catch Abundance by running them down. In _Virginia_ (where only I have seen them) they are as much in Request, for the Delicacy of their Flesh, as the Rice-Bird is in _Carolina_, or the Ortolan in _Europe_.

## Gentiana Virginiana, Saponariae, folio, flore caeruleo longiore.

This Plant grows in Ditches and shady moist Places, rising usually sixteen Inches high, with upright strait Stems, having long sharp pointed Leaves, set opposite to each other, spreading horizontally. From the joints of the Leaves come forth four or five monopetalous blue Flowers; which, before they open, are in Form of a Rolling-Pin; but, when blown, are in shape of a Cup, with the Verge divided into five sections.

# 71

## Pluvialis Vociferus: The chattering Plover.

This is about the Size of the larger Snipe. The Eyes are large, with scarlet Circle. A black Lift runs from the Bill under the Eyes. The Forehead is white; above which it is black. The Rest of the Head is brown. The Throat and round the Neck is white; under which there is a broad black Lift encompassing the Neck. Another Lift of black crosses the Breast, from the Shoulder of one Wing to that of the other. Except which, the Breast and Belly are white. The Back and Wings are brown; the larger Quill-Feathers being of a darker brown. The small Rump-Feathers, which cover three Quarters of the Tail, are of a yellowish red. The lower Part of the Tail is black. The Legs and Feet of a Straw-Colour. It hath no back Toes. These Birds are very frequent both in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_; and are a great Hinderance to Fowlers by alarming the Game with their screaming Noise. In _Virginia_ they are called _Killdeers_, from some Resemblance of their Noise to the Sound of that Word. They abide in _Carolina_ and _Virginia_ all the Year. The Feathers of the Cock and Hen differ not much.

Frutex foliis oblongis acuminatis, floribus spicatis unoversu dispositis: The Sorrel-Tree.

The Trunc of this Tree is usually five or six Inches thick, and rises to the Height of about twenty Feet, with slender Branches thick set with Leaves, shaped like those of the Pear-Tree. From the Ends of the Branches proceed little white monopetalous Flowers, like those of the Strawberry-Tree, which are thick set on short Footstalks to one Side of many slender Stalks, which are pendant on one Side of the main Branch.

# 72

## Morinellus Marinus of Sir Thomas Brown. An Cinclus Turneri?: 
The Turn-Stone or Sea-Dottrel.

This Bird has, in Proportion to its Body, a small Head, with a strait taper black Bill, an Inch long. All the Upper-part of the Body is brown, with a mixture of white and black. The Quill-Feathers of the Wings are dark brown; the Neck and Breast black; the Legs and Feet light red. In a Voyage to _America_, _Anno_ 1722, in 31 Deg. N. Lat. and 40 Leagues from the Coast of _Florida_, the Bird from which this was figur'd flew on Board us and was taken. It was very active in turning up Stones, which we put into its Cage; but not finding under them the usual Food, it died. In this Action it moved only the upper Mandible; yet would with great Dexterity and Quickness turn over Stones of above three Pounds Weight. This Property Nature seems to have given it for the finding of its Food; which is probably Worms and Insects on the Sea-Shore. By comparing This with the Description of That in _Will. Ornithog_. which I had then on board, I found this to be the same Kind with that he describes.

## Arbor maritima, foliis conjugatis pyriformibus apice in summitate instructis, floribus racemosis luteis.

This Plant grows usually to the Height of four or five Feet, with many strait ligneous Stems; to which are set opposite to each other at the Distance of five or six Inches, smaller single Stems. The Leaves grew opposite to one another on Footstalks half on Inch long, being narrow next the Stalk, and broad at the End; where they are a little pointed; in Shape like a Pear. The Flowers grow in Tufts, at the Ends of the Branches, on short Footstalks; each Flower being form'd like a Cup, with yellow _Apices_.

# 73

## Phoenicopterus Bahamensis: The Flamingo.

This Bird is two Years before it arrives at its perfect Colour; and then 'tis entirely red, except the Quill-Feathers, which are black. A full grown one is of equal Weight with a Wild-Duck; and, when it stands erect is five Feet high. The Feet are webbed. The Flesh is delicate and nearest resembles that of a Partridge in Taste. The Tongue, above any other Part, was in the highest Esteem with the luxurious _Romans_ for its exquisite Flavour.

These Birds make their Nests on Hillocks in shallow Water; on which they sit with their Legs extended down, like a Man sitting on a Stool. They breed on the Coasts of _Cuba_ and the _Bahama_-Islands, and frequent Salt-Water only. A Man, by concealing himself from their Sight, may kill great Numbers of 'em, for they will not rise at the Report of a Gun; nor is the Sight of those killed close by them sufficient to terrify the Rest and warn 'em of the Danger; but they stand gazing, and as it were astonish'd, till they are most or all of them kill'd.

This Bird resembles the Heron in Shape, excepting the Bill, which being of a very singular Form, I shall, in the next Table give the Figure of it in its full Size, with a particular Description.

## Keratophyton Dichotomum fuscum.

This Plant ariseth from a short Stem about two Inches round, and about the same in Height; where it divides into two larger Branches, and so generally, at the Distance of three or four Inches, each Branch divides into two smaller, till the whole Plant is risen to about two Feet, and the upper Branches are become not thicker than a Crow's Quill; all pliant like Horn or Whale-bone, and of a dark brown Colour. They are in great Plenty at the Bottom of the shallow Seas and Channels of the _Bahama_ Islands, the Water there being exceeding clear. I have plainly seen them growing to the white Rocks in above ten Fathom Water.

# 74

## Caput Phoenicopteri Naturalis Magnitudinis: The Bill of the Flamingo in its full Dimension.

I Need not attempt to describe the Texture of the Bill otherwise than Dr. _Grew_ has done in his _Mus. R. Sac_. p. 67. His Words are these: "The Figure of each Beak is truly Hyperbolical. The upper is ridg'd behind; before, plain or flat and pointed like a Sword, and with the Extremity bended a little down; within, it path an Angle or sharp Ridge, which runs all along the Middle, at the Top of the Hyperbole, not above a Quarter of an Inch high. The lower Beak in the same Place above one Inch high, hollow and the Margins strangely expanded inward, for the Breadth of above a quarter of an Inch, and somewhat convexly. They are both furnished with black Teeth, as I call them, from their Use, of an unusual Figure; _Scil_. slender, numerous, and parrallel, as in Ivory-Combs; but also very short, scarce the eighth Part of an Inch deep. An admirable Invention of Nature; by the Help of which, and of the sharp Ride abovementioned, this Bird holds his slippery Prey the faster."

When they feed (which is always in shallow Water) by bending their Neck, they lay the upper part of their Bill next the Ground, their Feet being in continual Motion up and down in the Mud; by which Means they raise a small round Sort of Grain, resembling Millet, which they receive into their Bill. And as there is a Necessity of admitting into their Mouths some Mud, Nature has provided the Edges of their Bill with a Sieve, or Teeth, like those of a fine Comb, with which they retain the Food, and reject the Mud that is taken in with it. This Account I had from Persons of Credit; but I never saw them feeding my self, and therefore cannot absolutely refute the Opinion of others, who say they feed on Fish, particularly Eels, which seem to be the slippery Prey Dr. _Grew_ says the Teeth are contrived to hold.

The accurate Dr. _James Douglass_ hath obliged the World with a curious and ample Description of this Bird in _Phil. Trans_. No 550.


## Keratophyton fructis Specie, nigrum.

This Species differs from the former, in that it is black, and hath a large Stem like the Trunc of a Tree, which rises up thro' the Middle of the Plant, and sends out several larger Branches, from which arise the smaller Twigs, which are more crooked and slender than those of the proceeding: So that in the Whole it resembles a Tree without Leaves.

This grows to Rocks in the same Places with the preceeding.

# 75

## Grus Americana Alba: The Hooping Crane.

Is about the Size of the common Crane. The Bill is brown, and six Inches long; the Edges of both Mandibles towards the End, about an Inch and half, are serrated. A deep and broad Channel runs from more than half way along its upper Mandible. Its Nostrils are very large. A broad white Lift runs from the Eyes obliquely to the Neck; except which the Head is brown. The Crown of the Head is callous and very hard, thinly beset with stiff black Hairs which lye flat, and are so thin that the Skin appears bare of a reddish Flesh-Colour. Behind the Head is a Peek of black Feathers. The larger Wing-Feathers are black. All the Rest of the Body is white. This Description I took rom the entire Skin of the Bird, presented to me by an _Indian_ who made Use of it for his Tobacco-Pouch. He told me that early in the Spring great Multitudes of them frequent the lower Parts of the Rivers near the Sea; and return to the Mountains in the Summer. This Relation was afterwards confirmed to me by a white Man; who added, that they make a remarkable hooping Noise; and that he hath seen them at the Mouths of the _Savanna_, _Aratamaha_, and other Rivers nearer St. _Augustine_; but never saw any so far North as the Settlements of _Carolina_.

## Prunus Buxi folio cordato, fructu nigro rotundo: The Bullet-Bush.

The larger Part of the Stem of this Shrub is seldom bigger than the Small of a Man's Leg. The Height is usually five Feet. The Branches shoot forth near the Ground and spread. The Leaves are stiff like those of Box, and about the same Bigness, with Notches at the Ends. The Berries hang to the smaller Branches by Footstalks not half an Inch long, and are globular, somewhat larger than a Black Cherry, of a blueish Black; and contain each a single Stone.

# 76

## Ardea Caerulea: The Blue Heron.

This Bird weighs Fifteen Ounces and in Size is somewhat less than a Crow. The Bill is Blue; but darker towards the Point. The _Irides_ of the Eyes are Yellow. The Head and Neck are of a changeable Purple. All the Rest of the Body is Blue. The Legs and Feet are Green. From the Breast hang long narrow Feathers, as there do likewise from the Hind-part of the Head; and likewise on the Back are such like Feathers, which are a Foot in Length, and extend four Inches below the Tail, which is a little shorter than the Wings. These Birds are not numerous in _Carolina_; and are rarely seen but in the Spring of the Year.

Whence they come, and where they breed, is to me unknown.

# 77

## Ardea Alba Minor Carolinensis: The little white Heron.

This Bird is about the Size of the preceeding. The Bill is red. The Eyes have yellow _Irides_. The Legs and Feet are green. The whole Plumage is white. They feed on Fish, Frogs, _&c_. and frequent Rivers, Ponds and Marshes, after the Manner of other Herons.

I believe they breed in _Carolina_; but I have never seen any of them in Winter.

## Ketmia frutescens glauca, Aceris majoris folio longiore, serrato flore carneo.

This Plant rises with several Stems usually five Feet high, producing broad serrated downy Leaves, like the broad-leaved Maple, divided by six Sections. The Flowers are in Clusters, on the Top of the Stalk; of a pale red, and divided by five Segments. The Fruit is round and ribbed, about the Bigness of a large Hazel- among the Rocks of the _Bahama_ Islands.

# 78

## Ardea Stellaris Americana: The Brown Bittern.

This is somewhat less than our _English_ Bittern. The Bill is four Inches long; the End and upper-part of it black, the under-part green. The Eyes are large, having Gold-colour'd _Irides_, environ'd with a green Skin. The whole Body is brown, with a Mixture of white Feathers; the Back being darker. The Breast and Belly more white. Most of the large Wing-Feathers are white at the Ends. The Tail is short and of a Lead-Colour. The Legs and Feet are of a yellowish Green. The outer and middle Toe are joined by a Membrane. The interior Side of the middle Toe is serrated. These Birds frequent fresh Rivers and Ponds in the upper Parts of the Country, remote from the Sea.

# 79

## Ardea Stellaris Cristata Americana: The crested Bittern.

Weighs a Pound and half. The Bill is black and strong. The Eyes very large and prominent, with red _Irides_. The Skin encompassing the Eyes is green. The Crown of the Head, from the Basis of the Bill, of a pale yellow terminating in a Peak; from which hang three or four long white Feathers, the longest of which is six Inches; which they erect, when irritated. From the Angle of the Mouth runs a broad white Lift. The Rest of the Head is of a blueish black. The Neck, Breast and Belly dusky blue. The Back is striped with black Streaks, with a Mixture of white. From the Upper-part of the Back shoot many long narrow Feathers, extending beyond the Tail; some of which are Seven Inches long. The large Feathers of the Wing are brown, with a Tincture of blue. The Legs and Feet are yellow. These Birds are seen in _Carolina_ in the rainy Seasons; but in the _Bahama_ Islands, they breed in Bushes growing among the Rocks in prodigious Numbers, and are of great Use to the Inhabitants there; who, while these Birds are young, and before they can fly, employ themselves in taking them, for the Delicacy of their Food. They are, in some of these rocky Islands, so numerous, that in a few Hours, two Men will load one of their _Calapatches_ or little Boats, taking them pearching from off the Rocks and Bushes; they making no Attempt to escape, tho' almost full grown. They are called by the _Bahamians_, Crab-catchers, Crabs being what they mostly subsist on; yet they are well-tasted, and free from any rank or fishy Savour.

## Lobelia frutescens, Portulacae folio.

This Plant grows usually to the Height of five or six Feet. The Leaves are, in Thickness and Form, not unlike Purslain. At the End of a Stalk, growing from the Joint of a Leaf, there are set three or four monopetalous white Flowers, divided into five Pointed Sections, with a wreathed _Stamen_ hanging out. The Flower here exhibited is slit down to the Basis and laid flat open. The Flowers are succeeded by globular Berries, of the Size of black Bullace, containing a Stone, covered with a smooth black Skin. These Plants grow on the rocky Shores of many of the _Bahama_ Islands.

## Ardea Stellaris Minima: The Small Bittern.

The Bill, from the Angle of the Mouth to the End, was a little more than six Inches long, and black, except some Part of the under Mandible, which was yellow. The Eyes yellow. A Crest of long green Feathers covers the Crown of the Head. The Neck and Breast of a dark muddy red. The Back cover'd with long narrow pale-green Feathers. The large Quill-Feathers of the Wing of a very dark green, with a Tincture of purple. All the Rest of the Wing-Feathers of a changeable shining green, having some feathers edged with yellow. The Legs and Feet brown. They have a long Neck, but usually sit with it contracted, on Trees hanging over Rivers, in a lonely Manner waiting for their Prey, which is Frogs, Crabs, and other small Fish.

I don't remember to have seen any of them in Winter: Wherefore I believe, they retire from _Virginia_ and _Carolina_ more South.

## Fraxinus Carolinensis, foliis angustioribus utrinque acuminatis, pendulis.

Commonly of a mean Size and Height. The Leaves are pointed at both Ends. The Seeds are winged, and hang in Clusters. They grow in low moist Places.

# 81

## Pelicanus Americanus: The Wood Pelican.

This is about the bigness of a Goose; the Bill is nine inches and an half long, and curved towards the end, and next the Head very big, being six inches and a half in circumference. The fore-part of the Head is cover'd with a dark-blewish skin, bare of feathers, the back-part of the Head and Neck brown. The Wings are large: all the lower part of them, from the Shoulders to the ends, particularly the quillfeathers, appear black at a distance, but are shaded with green: the upper part of the Wing is white: the Tail is black, very short, and square at the end; all the rest of the Body is white. The Legs are black and very long, the Feet webbed; not so much as those of a Duck, but are joined by a Membrane reaching to the first joint of every toe, except the hindmost, which has no Membrane, and is longer than common. That which demonstrates this Bird to be of the Pelican-kind, is the Pouch under the Bill, tho' it is small, and contains not more than half a pint. In the latter end of Summer there usually fall great rains in _Carolina_, at which time numerous Flights of these Birds frequent the open _Savannas_, which are then under water, and they retire before _November_. They are very good Eating Fowls, tho' they feed on Fish and other Water-animals. It is a stupid Bird and void of fear, easily to be shot. They fit in great numbers on tall Cypress and other Trees in an erect posture, resting their ponderous Bills on their Necks for their greater ease. I could not perceive any difference in the colours of the Male and Female.

# 82

## Numenius Albas: The White Curlew.

This is about the Size of a tame Pigeon; the Bill is six Inches and an half long of a pale red Colour, chanelled from the Basis to the Point. The Iris of the Eyes are, gray; the fore-part of the Head, and round the Eyes, is covered with a light red Skin; four of the largest Wing-feathers have their Ends dark green. All the rest of the Bird is white, except the Legs and Feet which are pale red. The Flesh, particularly the Fat, is very yellow, of a Saffron colour. When the great Rains fall, which is usual at the latter End of Summer, these Birds arrive in _Carolina_ in great Numbers, and frequent the low Watery Lands.

The Cock and Hen are alike in Appearance.

## Arum aquaticum minus.

This Plant grows by the Sides of Rivers, and in watery Places; the Root is tuberous, from which springs many broad Oval Leaves eight or ten Inches wide, on thick succulent round Stalks, to the Height of about four Feet. From the Root also shoot forth many of the like Stalks producing blew Flowers at the End of every Stalk, but as I had not an Opportunity of observing them more critically while in Blossom, I shall only take Notice that the Flowers are succeeded by a Bunch of green Berries closely connected together, regularly, in the Manner of a Pine-Apple. These Berries never harden, but drop off when ripe, being of the Colour, Shape and Consistance of _Capers_.

# 83

## Numenius Fuscus: The Brown Curlew.

This is about the Size of the White Curlew: it has the same Sort of Bill, with Red round the Basis of it, and Eyes as the white Curlew; the rest of the Head and Neck of a mixt Gray. The upper part of the Back, Wings, and Tail, are brown. The lower Part of the Back and Rump white, as is the Under part of the Body. The Legs are reddish like those of the White, as is likewise its Shape and Size. This near resemblance in them made me suspect they differ'd only in Sex, but by opening them I found Testicles in both the Kinds. The Flesh of this is dark, having not that yellow Colour which is in the White Curlew. They both feed and associate in Flocks, yet the white are twenty times more numerous than the brown Kind. In the Gizzard were Crawfish. Both these Kinds, accompanied with the Wood Pelicans, come annually about the middle of _September_, and frequent the watery _Savannas_ in numerous Flights, continuing about Six Weeks, and then retire, and are no more seen until that time next Year. In many of the Hens of the white Kind were Clusters of Eggs; from which I imagine they retire somewhere South to breed; _Carolina_ at that time of the Year would probably be too cold for that Work of Nature, it being much colder in the same Latitude in that Part of the World than in _Europe_. Very little or no Difference appear in the Feathers of the Cock and Hen.

## Arum Sagitariae folio angusto, acumine & auriculis acutissimis.

This Plant grows in Ditches and shallow Water to the Height of three or four Feet, with many Arrow-headed Leaves, on long succulent Stalks springing from a tuberous Root, from which also shoot forth large round Stalks, at the End of each of which grows in a hanging posture a large roundish green Seed Vessel or Capsula, containing many globular green Berries of different bigness, some of the Size of Musket Bullets, and others but half as big; this Seed Vessel (which is about the Size of a Hen's Egg) when mature opens on both Sides, and discloses the Seeds, which are green and tender when ripe. I have seen the _Indians_ boil them with their Venison. They were excessive hot and adstringent in my Mouth, while green, but when boiled they lost those Qualities, and were very palatable, and, as they said, wholesome. They are ripe in _July_.

# 84

## Numenius Ruber: The Red Curlew.

Is a larger Bird than the precedent, being about the bigness of a common Crow. The Bill is in form like that of other Curlews, and of a pale red colour: on the fore-part of the Head, and round the Eyes, is a skin of the same colour as the Bill, and bare of feathers: the Legs are likewise of a pale red colour: about an inch of the end the Wings are black, all the rest of the Bird is red.

These Birds frequent the Coasts of the _Bahama_ Islands and other parts of _America_ between the Tropicks, and are seldom seen to the North or South of the Tropicks. The Hens are of a dirtier red than the Cocks.

# 85

## Haematopus: The Oyster Catcher.

Weighs one pound and two ounces; the Bill long, streight and of a bright red colour, contracted near the basis, and towards the end compress'd: the Irides of their Eyes are yellow, encompassed with a red Circle: the whole Head and Neck black, having a spot of white under the Eyes; all the under part of the Body, dusky white: the larger Quill-feathers are dusky black: the Tail is short, black towards the End, and towards the Rump white: the upper part of the Body and Wings, brown, except a broad white line, which runs along the middle of each Wing; the Legs are long and thick, and of a reddish colour. It has only three fore-toes, wanting the back-toe. Their Feet are remarkably armed with a very rough scaly skin. In Rivers and Creeks near the Sea there are great quantities of Oyster-banks, which at low Water are left bare: On these Banks of Oysters do these Birds principally, if not altogether, subsist; Nature having not only formed their Bills suitable to the Work, but armed the Feet and Legs for a defence against the sharp edges of the Oysters. The Hens differ from the Cocks in not having the red circle round their Eyes, and their Bellies are of a more dirty white than in the Cocks: In the Maw of one was found nothing but indigested Oysters.

This Bird seems to be the _Haematopus of Bellonius, Will. p_. 297. notwithstanding there is some small difference in their description. I have seen them on the Sea Coasts both of _Carolina_ and the _Bahama_ Islands.

## Frutex Bahamensis foliis oblongis succulentis, fructu subrotundo unicum nucleum continente.

This grows to the size of a small Tree; the leaves stand by pairs on foot-stalks about an inch long; they are long, thick and succulent: at the ends of the stalks grow in pairs, and sometimes singly, round flat Seed-vessels, about the breadth of a shilling: the fruit is of the substance of a Bean, and, like that, divides in the middle: it is cover'd with a thin membrane of a pale green colour. I had no opportunity of seeing the Blossoms, tho' I was told they were very small and white. The Bark of this Tree is used for tanning of Sole-leather.

# 86

## Anseri Bassano congener Avis fluviatalis: The Great Booby.

It's Size is about that of a Goose, the Head and Neck remarkably thick the Bill large, and almost Six Inches in length, a channel or cranny extends from one End to the other of the Upper Mandible. The Wings extended six Feet, and when clos'd, reach to the End of the Tail. The middle Feather of the Tail was longest, the Rest gradually decreasing in length, the Eyes are large, of a hazel Colour, encompassed with a Skin bare of Feathers. These Birds were of a dark brown colour, elegantly spotted with white on their Heads, the Spots are thick and small, on the Neck and Breast they are thinner and broader, and on the Back thinnest and broadest. The Wings are likewise spotted, except the large Quill-Feathers and the Tail, which are brown. The Belly of a dusky white. The Feet black, and shaped like those of a Cormorant. That which is most remarkable in these Birds is, that the Upper Mandible of the Bill, two Inches below the Angle of the Mouth is jointed, by which it can raise it from the lower Mandible two Inches, without opening their Mouths.

This Bird so nearly resembles the Booby (particularly in the singular Structure of the Bill) that I thought the Name of Great Booby agreed best with it. It frequents large Rivers, and plunges into them after Fish, in like Manner as the Booby does at Sea, continuing under Water a considerable Time, and there pursuing the Fish: And as as I have several times found them disabled and sometimes dead on the Shore, probably they meet with Sharks and other large voracious Fishes that maim and sometimes devour them. They frequent the Rivers and Sea Coast of _Florida_. The Colours of the Cock are brighter, and more beautiful than those of the Hen.

## An Thymelaea foliis obtusis.

This Shrub riseth to the Height of eight or ten Foot, with a small Trunc covered with a whitish Bark, the Leaves are placed alternately on Footstalks, one third of an Inch long, narrow at the Beginning, growing broader and rounding at the Ends, two Inches long, and one over, where broadest of a shining Green, with one single Rib. The Flowers are tubulous, divided at Top into four Sections, they are white, except that within the Cup there is a faint Tincture of red, they grow in Bunches at the Ends of the Branches.

These Shrubs grow in many of the _Bahama_-Islands on the Rocky Shores amongst Sedge.

# 87

## Anseri Bassano Fusca Avis: The Booby.

The Bill is yellow, and bare of feathers; in which the Eyes are placed of a light gray colour; the lower part of the Bill is of a light brown. These Birds vary so, that they are not to be distinguished by their colours only: in one of them the Belly was white, and the Back brown; in another the Breast and Belly was brown; in others all brown; nor could I perceive any outward difference in the Cock and Hen. Their Wings are very long; their Legs and Feet pale yellow, and shap'd like those of Cormorants. They frequent the _Bahama_ Islands, where they breed all months in the year. They lay one, two, and sometimes three eggs on the bare rocks. _Dampier_ says, they breed on Trees in an Island called _Bon-airy_, in the _West-Indies_, which he observes not to have seen elsewhere. While young, they are covered with a white Down, and remain so till they are almost ready to fly. They subsist on Fish only, which they catch by diving. This and the great Booby are remarkable for having a joint in the upper mandible of the Bill.

It is diverting to see the frequent contests between the Booby and the Man of War Bird, which last lives on rapine and spoil of other Sea Birds, particularly the Booby; which so soon as the Man of War Bird perceives he hath taken a Fish, flies furiously at him, and obliges the Booby for his security to dive under water. The Man of War Bird being incapable of following him, hovers over the place till the Booby rises to breathe, and then attacks him again, and so repeats it at every opportunity, 'till the Booby at length, tired and breathless, is necessitated to resign his fish: yet not being discouraged, industriously goes to fishing again, and suffers repeated losses by fresh assaults from his rapacious Enemy.

Having had no opportunity of seeing the Man of War Bird any otherwise than in the Air, I cannot well describe it, nor say any thing more of it, except what has been related to me, which is this: While they are sitting and hatching their young, their Heads change from a brown to a Scarlet colour, which becomes brown again when they have done breeding: This was affirmed to me by many who have often seen them on their Nests; for at that time they are very tame, and will suffer one to come near to them, tho' at other times very wild. These Birds are numerous on most of the _Bahama_ Islands.

# 88

## Hirundo Marina Minor Capite Albo: The Noddy.

Weighs four ounces. The Bill black, long and sharp: the Eyes above and below are edged with white. The Crown of the Head white, which grows gradually dusky towards the back part of the Head. All the rest of these Birds are brown, their Tails and Quill-feathers being darkest. Their Wings and Tails are of an equal length. They lay their Eggs on bare Rocks on many of the _Bahama_ Islands, where they breed in company with Boobies. It is pleasant to see them fishing, accompanied with variety of other Sea-Birds in numerous flights, flying on the surface of the water, and continually dropping to snatch up the little fish drove in sholes by larger ones to the surface of the water. This seems to be done with great pleasure and merriment, if we may judge from the various Notes and great noise they make, which is heard some miles off. The sholes of fish they follow, cause a ripling and whiteness in the water, which is a plain direction for the Birds to follow them, and may be seen from the Hills several miles off. Where the ripling appears most there the Birds swarm thickest. This is done in breeding time, but that being past, these Noddies roam the 0cean over separately, and are seen several hundred leagues from any land, but are seldom met with without the Tropicks. They are stupid Birds, and like the Booby will suffer themselves to be laid hands on and taken from off the yards or parts of the Ships on which they alight. The Cocks and Hens differ very little in colour.

# 89

## Larus Major: The Laughing Gull.

This Bird weighs eight ounces. The Bill is red, hooked towards the point; the lower mandible having an angle towards the end: the Head, of a dusky black: the Eyes are edged above and below with white: half the Quill-feathers of the wing, towards the ends, are dusky black: all the rest of the Body is white, as is the Tail, the feathers of which are of an equal length, and not so long as the wings by two inches: the Legs are black, as are also the Feet, which are webbed.

These Birds are numerous in most of the _Bahama_ Islands. The noise they make has some resemblance to laughing, from which they seem to take their name. I know not whether the Hen differs from this, which is a Cock.

# 90

## Laurus Major rostro inaequali: The Cut Water.

The Bill, which is the characteristick note of this Bird, is a wonderful work of Nature. The upper Mandible is thick and compressed sideways gradually to the end, and terminates in a point, and is three inches long. The under Mandible is more compressed than the upper, and very thin, both edges being as sharp as a knife, and is almost an inch longer than the upper Mandible, which has a narrow Grove or Channel, into which the upper Edge of the lower Mandible shuts. Half the Bill, next the Head, is red, the rest is black; the forepart of the Head, Neck, Breast and Belly white; the hindpart of the Head, Back and Wings black, with a small Mixture of white. The upper Feather of the Tail is black, the rest white. The Legs are short and small, of a red Colour. The Feet are webbed like those of a Gull, with a small back Toe. These Birds frequent near the Sea Coasts of _Carolina_. They fly close to the Surface of the Water, from which they seem to receive somewhat of Food. They also frequent Oyster-banks, on which, I believe, they feed. The structure of their Bills seem adapted to that purpose. The Cocks and Hens are alike in colour.

# 91

## Prodicipes Minor Rostro vario: The Pied-Bill Dopchick.

This Bird weighs half a pound. The Eyes are large, encompassed with a white Circle: the Throat has a black spot; a black lift crosses the middle of the Bill; the lower mandible, next the Basis, has a black spot: the Head and Neck, brown, particularly the Crown of the Head and Back of the Neck is darkest: the Feathers of the Breast are light brown, mixt with green, the Belly dusky white; the Back and Wings are brown.

These Birds frequent fresh water-Ponds in many of the inhabited parts of _Carolina_. This was a Male.

# 92

## Anser Canadensis: The Canada Goose.

This Bird is described by Mr. _Willoughby_ p. 361. By comparing it with his Description, and finding them agree, I conceive it sufficient to recite his Account of it as follows: "Its Length, from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail, or of the Feet, is forty two inches. The Bill it self from the Angles of the Mouth is extended two inches, and is black of colour: the Nostrils are large. In shape of Body it is like to a tame Goose, save that it seems to be a little longer. The Rump is black; but the Feathers next above the Tail, white: the Back of a dark gray, like the common Goose's; the lower part of the Neck is white, else the Neck black. It hath a kind of white Stay or Muffler under the Chin, continued on each side below the Eyes to the Back of the Head. The belly is white: the Tail black, as are also the greater Quill-feathers of the Wings. The Eyes are Hazel-colour'd; the Edges of the Eyelids white; the Feet black, having the Hind-toe."

The white Stay or Muffler before mentioned is sufficient to distinguish it from all other of the Goose kind.

In Winter they come from the Northern parts of _America_ to _Carolina_, &c.

# 93

## Anas Bahamensis rostro plumbeo, macula Aurantii coloris: The Ilathera Duck.

This is somewhat less than the common tame Duck. The Bill is dusky blue, except on each side of the upper Mandible: next the Head is an Orange-colour'd triangular Spot; the Throat and all the fore part of the Neck, to the Eyes, is white: the upper part of the Head is of a mixed gray, inclining to yellow; as is the Back and the Belly: the upper part of the Wing and Quill-feathers are dark brown; in the middle of the Wing is a Row of green Feathers as in the common Teal, bordered towards the Quill-ends with yellow, and their ends black; below which, and next to the Quill-feathers, is a Row of yellow Feathers. The Feet are of a Lead-colour.

These Birds frequent the _Bahama_ Islands, but are not numerous, I never having seen but one, which was a Drake.

## Chrysanthemum Bermudense Leucoji, foliis virentibus crassis.

This Plant grows on Rocks on the Sea-Shores of most of the _Bahama-Islands_. It grows usually to the Height of 4 or 5 Feet, with many pliant green Stems arising from the Root; the Leaves are long, increasing in width gradually to the End; and in Form resembling the Leaves of the Stock Gilly-flower; they are thick, succulent and of a shining Green, standing opposite to one another. The Flowers grow singly at the Ends of the Branches, on Foot-stalks of four inches long.

# 94

## Anas Cristatus: The round-crested Duck.

This Bird is somewhat less than a common tame Duck; the Eyes yellow: the Bill is black and narrow; the upper Mandible hooked at the end, and both Mandibles serrated. This texture of the Bill shews it to be of the kind of MERGI. _Vid. Willoughby p_. 335. _Tab_. 64. The Head is crowned with a very large circular Crest, or Tuft of Feather; the middle of which, on each side, is white, and bordered round with black, which black extends to and covers the Throat and Neck. The Breast and Belly is white; the Quill-feathers of the Wings are brown; just above which are some smaller Feathers, whose exterior Vanes are edged with white, with a little white intermix'd in them, as in some of the other Feathers likewise. The Tail is brown, as is also the hindmost part of the Belly near the Vent, and under the rest of their Wings and Body is dusky black. The Females are all over of a brown colour, having a smaller Tuft of Feathers of the same colour. They frequent fresh waters, more especially Mill-ponds in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_.

# 95

## Anas Minor Purpureo Capite: The Bussel's Head Duck.

As to the Size of this Bird, it is between the common Duck and Teal. The Bill lead-colour; on each side the Head is a broad space of white; except which, the whole Head is adorned with long loose Feathers elegantly blended with blue, green and purple: the length and loosness of these; Feathers make the Head appear bigger than it is, which seems to have given it the Name of Bussel's Head, that Animal's Head appearing very big by it's being covered with very thick long Hair. The Wings and upper part of the Body have alternate lifts of white and black, extending from the Shoulders of the Wings and Back down to the Rump, viz. The Quill-feathers are black; next to them extends a line of white, next to which is a line of black, then a line of white, and then black, which covers the middle of the Back. The Tail is gray; the Legs are red.

The Female is all over of a brown colour; the Head smooth, and without a Ruff; the Legs and Feet brown. They frequent fresh Waters, and appear in _Carolina_ only in Winter.

# 96

## Anas Americanus lato rostro: The Blue-wing Shoveler.

This is somewhat less than a common Duck. The Eyes are yellow; the upper part of the Wing is covered with pale blue Feathers, below which is a Row of white Feathers, and below them a Row of green; the rest of the lower part of the Wing is brown; all the other part of the Body is of a mixed brown, not unlike in colour to the common Wild Duck. This Bird does not altogether agree with that described by Mr. _Willoughby_, p. 370. But if, as he observes, they change their colours in Winter, it is possible this may be the Bird. However, as their Bills are of the same form, and by which they may be distinguish'd from all others of the Duck kind, I cannot describe it in better Words than the above excellent Author. "It's Bill is three inches long, coal black (tho' this is of a reddish brown, spotted with black) much broader toward the tip than at the base, excavated like a Buckler, of a round circumference. At the end it hath a small crooked Hook or Nail; each Mandible is pectinated or toothed like a Comb, With Rays or thin Plates inserted mutually one into another, when the Bill is shut. The Legs and Feet are red." I am not certain whether this was a Male or Female.

# 97

## Anas Americanus cristatus elegans: The Summer Duck.

This is of a mean Size, between the common Wild Duck and Teal. The Bill is red, with a black Spot on the middle of it, and a black Nail or horny substance on the End, the Basis of the Bill is edged about with a yellow fleshy protuberance, pointing on each Side towards the Eyes, the Irides of which are very large and red, encompassed with a red Circle. The Crown of the Head is elegantly covered with a double Plume of long Feathers composed of blew, green and purple Colours, hanging down separately behind its Head, and divided by a narrow white Line, extending from the upper part of the Basis of the Bill backward: the lower Plume is likewise bordered with a white Line, beginning at the Eyes and running parrallel with the other, dividing the Plume from the under part of the Head, which is purple. The Throat is white, from each Side whereof proceed two white lines, one branching up towards the Crown of the Head, and the other below it, crossing the Neck. The Breast is of a muddy red, sprinkled thick over with white Spots, like Ermin. A little above the Shoulder is a broad white line, extended transversly, below which, and joining to it, runs a broad black Lift. The Back and upper parts of the Wings are variously and changeably coloured with brown, blue, and purple. The small Feathers near the Vent, are of a reddish purple, from amongst which spring two small yellow Feathers. The Tail is blue and purple. The lower part or verge of the Wings are lapped over and covered by the small downy side Feathers, extending from the Shoulders halfway the Wings, displaying alternately and in a wonderful manner black and white pointed Lines, varying in Appearance according to the Motion of the Bird, and different Position it puts its Feathers into, which adds much to the Beauty of it. The Sides of the Body below the Wings are brown, with transverse waved Lines, as in many of the Duck kind; the Legs and Feet of a reddish brown. They breed in _Virginia_ and _Carolina_, and make their Nests in the Holes of tall Trees (made by Wood-peckers) growing in Water, particularly Cypress Trees. While they are young and unable to fly, the Old ones carry them on their Backs from their Nests into the Water; and at the Approach of Danger, they fix with their Bills on the Backs of the Old ones, which fly away with them. The Female is all over brown.

# 98

## Anas Minor ex albo & fuseo vario: The little brown Duck.

This Duck has a large white Spot on each side the Head, and another on the lower part of the Wing; except which, the Head and all the upper part of the Body and Wings are dark brown; the Breast and Belly light gray, the Bill black, the Irides of the Eyes of a Hazel-colour. This was a Female. The Male was pyed black and white; but not being able to procure it, I am necessitated to be thus short in the description. They frequent the lower parts of Rivers in _Carolina_, where the Water is salt, or brakish.

## Frutex Buxi foliis oblongis, baccis pallide viridibus apice donatis: Soap-Wood.

Shrub or small Tree rises to the Height of about 6 or 8 foot, and usually with one strait Stem covered with a whitish Bark; the Leaves in Size, Shape and Substance resemble those of Box, and many of them grow concave and curling, with their edges inward. At the Ends of the smaller Twigs grow Bunches of round pale green Berries of the Size of large Peas, set on Foot-stalks a quarter of an Inch long with a small indented Capsula. These Berries contain an uncertain number of (four, five, and some six) small brown Seeds covered with a Mucilage. The Bark and Leaves of this Tree being beat in a Morter produces a Lather; and is made Use of to wash Cloaths and Linnen, to which last it gives a yellowness. The Hunters who frequent the desolate Islands of _Bahama_, (where this Shrub grows on the Sea-Coast) are frequently necessitated to use this Sort of soap to wash their Shirts, for want of better.

# 99

## Querquidula Americana Fusca: The Blue-wing Teal.

Is somewhat bigger than the common Teal, the Bill black; the Head, and most part of the Body of a mixt gray, like that of a Wild Duck, the Back being darker than the under part of the Body; the upper part of the Wing is of a bright blue, below which ranges a narrow Row of white Feathers; next to them a Row of green; the rest of the Wing, being the Quill-feathers, is dark brown, the Legs and Feet, brown. The Female is all brown, like a common Wild Duck.

In _August_ these Birds come in great plenty to _Carolina_, and continue till the middle of _October_, at which time the Rice is gather'd in, on which they feed. In _Virginia_, where no Rice grows, they feed on a kind of Wild Oate growing in the Marshes, and in both places they become extreamly fat.

They are not only by the Natives preferred to all other Water-fowl, but others, who have eat of them, give them the preference to all of the Duck kind for delicacy of taste.

# 100

## Querquedula Americana Variegata: The White-Face Teal.

In bigness this exceeds a common Teal; the Bill black; the Crown of the Head is black, which extends along the Basis of the Bill to the Throat, between which and the Eyes it is white; all the Rest of the Head is purple mixt with green; the Breast and Belly, in Colour, like that of a common Teal; the upper Part of the Back, next the Head is brown, curiously waved like the curdling of Water; the lower part of the Back is covered with long sharp-pointed Feathers of a light brown Colour. The Wings are colour'd as those of the Blue-wing Teal. The Tail is brown, and somewhat longer than the Wings; the Vent Feathers under the Tail are black; the Legs and Feet yellow. The Female is all over brown. They frequent Ponds and Fresh-water Rivers in _Carolina_.
